<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A LETTER</h3>
</div>

<p>A solitary hut, dismal, rectangular, stands on
the north bank of the White River. Decay has long
been at work upon it, yet it is still weather-proof. It
was built long before planks were used in the Bad
Lands of Dakota. It was built by hands that aimed
only at strength and durability, caring nothing for
appearances. Thus it has survived where a lighter
construction must long since have been demolished.</p>
<p>And it still affords habitation for man. The windows
have no glass; the door is a crazy affair; there is
an unevenness in the setting of the lateral logs which
compose its walls; the reed thatching has been
patched where the weather has rotted it; and here
and there small spreads of tarpaulin lend their aid in
keeping out the snows of winter and the storms of
summer. It occupies its place, a queer, squat sentry,
standing midway between the cattle ford and the
newer log wagon-bridge lower down the river toward
its mouth, where it joins the giant Missouri some two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
hundred miles distant. It backs into the brush fringing
the wood-lined river bank, and is dangerously
sheltered from the two great Indian Reservations on
the other side of the river. Dangerously, because it
is at all times dangerous to live adjacent to woods
when so near such a restless race as the Indians on
the Rosebud and the Pine Ridge Reservations. Still,
it has stood there so long, and yet bears no sign of
hostile action directed against it by the warlike Sioux,
that it seems safe to reckon it will continue to stand
there in peace until decay finishes it off. And the
fact is significant.</p>
<p>Those who lived in that hut must have had reason
to know that they dwelt there in safety.</p>
<p>The present tenant of the hut is a white man. He
is seated on the tread of his crazy doorway, holding
an open letter in one hand, while he stares in an unpleasantly
reflective manner out across the prairie in
front of him.</p>
<p>And the letter, which is slowly crumpling under
the clutch of his nervous fingers, is worthy of attention,
for it is written on crested paper which is blue.
And the ink is blue, too, and might reasonably indicate
the tone of the blood of the sender, though
hardly of the recipient.</p>
<p>Still appearances are deceptive on the prairie with
regard to human beings, even more so perhaps than
elsewhere. This man has a something about him
which speaks of a different life&mdash;a life where people
live in greater ease and more refined surroundings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
But even so, his face is very mean and narrow; an
appearance in nowise improved by its weather-stained,
unwashed condition.</p>
<p>Nevil Steyne&mdash;for that is the man&#8217;s name&mdash;has
read the letter, and now he is thinking about it.
And as he thinks, and mentally digests that which a
right-minded man would accept as its overwhelmingly
kindly tone, his anger rises slowly at first, but
ever higher and higher, till it culminates in a bitter,
muttered exclamation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The crawler!&#8221; he said under his breath.</p>
<p>Suddenly he looked down at the paper, and proceeded
to straighten it out. And his pale blue eyes
were glittering as he read the letter again from beginning
to end. The very crest at the top was an
aggravation to him. And he conjured meaning between
the lines as he went, where meaning lay only
in what was written.</p>
<p>The heading bore a date at New York. It had
been written on the second of June&mdash;ten days earlier.
And it was a letter that should have put joy into his
heart, rather than have raised his anger and hatred.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Brother</span> (it ran)&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible that a letter from me may not
be as welcome as I try to hope. I can only trust
that your resentment against me has abated in these
long twelve years since you cut yourself out of my
life. I know you blamed me for what happened at
our father&#8217;s death. You said nothing, would not see
me, or the whole thing could have been adjusted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
then. You went off believing what was not true.
Whether father treated you justly or unjustly you
are the best judge. From my point of view it was
the latter. It was always a mystery to me that he
cut you out of his will. I was as disappointed as
you, and it is for that reason that, for twelve years, I
have been seeking you, to restore to you your share
of the property. My dear boy, I&#8217;m sure you cannot
imagine what joy it is to me that at last I am able to
write this, that at last I shall be able to say it to you.
We both know what a martinet father was, and what
a disappointment it was to him when you refused to
adopt the army and join me in following in the old
boy&#8217;s footsteps, but, unless there was something else
between you, that was insufficient reason for the injustice
of his will.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, all that is past now. What I have set aside
as your share is untouched, and has been accumulating
all these years. It is waiting for you. If you
refuse it, I shall never touch it. In that case it remains
tied up for my little daughter, at such time as
she shall marry. But of course I have done this
only as an emergency. You will not, I know, refuse
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God, I have found you at last, dear old
boy! Now, listen! I have set my plans with great
care, and hope you will appreciate them. I do not
want to subject you to any curiosity among our
friends&mdash;you know how inquisitive people are&mdash;so I
have come out here ostensibly on a big game shoot
in the Rockies. Alice, my wife&mdash;you remember
Alice Travers&mdash;and little Marjorie, our daughter, are
with me. They know nothing of my secret. We
shall break our journey at Sioux City, and then come
across to you by road. And, lo! when we arrive my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
little surprise for them&mdash;Marjorie finds an uncle,
Alice a brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;In conclusion, I hope to be with you on the 16th
at latest; we shall come by way of the south bank
of the Missouri River, then across the Pine Ridge
Reservation, and so on to Beacon Crossing. I hope
to find you as young in spirit as ever. I have many
gray hairs, but no matter, so long as I find you well
I shall be more than satisfied. <i>Au revoir.</i></p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='margin-right:4em;'>&#8220;Your affectionate</p>
<p style='margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Landor.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>&#8220;<i>Au revoir</i>,&#8221; muttered the man, as he viciously
tore the letter into the minutest fragments, and ground
them into the hard earth with a ruthless heel. &#8220;<i>Au
revoir</i>,&#8221; he said again, and louder. Then he laughed.
&#8220;But we haven&#8217;t met yet. Why should I take a share
when you and your wife, and your brat are the only
people who stand between me and the lot?&#8221;</p>
<p>And after that he relapsed into silence, and his
thoughts flew on apace. The unwashed face grew
meaner and more brooding, the fair brows drew
closer over the large blue eyes, the jaws were shut
as tight as they well could be, for he was painfully
overshot, and his chin was almost hidden, so far receding
was it under the long, drooping, tobacco-stained
moustache.</p>
<p>That letter, it would seem, required no depth of
thought, unless it were the happy thought that he
possessed such a brother. It seemed to be a moment
for nothing but happiness. And in such a man one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
might reasonably have expected to see him mount
the horse tethered a few yards away in front of the
hut, and ride into Beacon Crossing, where he could
tell his associates of his good fortune, and celebrate
it in the usual manner.</p>
<p>But there was nothing of happiness in the face
that stared so steadily out at the hazy sky-line in the
direction of the Cheyenne Reservation away to the
north. There was a hard look, such as is to be seen
only in pale blue eyes;&mdash;a look of unyielding hatred
and obstinacy; a look which, combined with the evident
weakness of character displayed in his features,
suggested rather the subtle treachery of a coward
than the fierce resentment of a brave man.</p>
<p>Never was a character more fully laid bare than
was his at that moment. He was conscious of his
isolation. There was no one to see. He hated his
brother as a weak nature hates a strong. He hated
him because years ago he, Nevil, had refused to go
into the army for the reason of an obstinate cowardice,
while his younger brother gladly embraced
the profession of which their father, the stern old
general, had been such an honored member. And
so he had eschewed his mother country, leaving
England, when he had been disinherited, for the wilderness
of South Dakota, and had become one of
those stormy petrels which, in those days, were ever
to be found hovering about the territory set apart
for the restless Indians. Yes, and with his destruction
of that kindly, simple letter his resolve had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
taken. He would have nothing at the hands of the
man who had ousted him.</p>
<p>It was not thoughts of his resolve that gave his
face its look of treacherous cunning now, but something
else. Something which kept him sitting on
his door-step thinking, thinking, until the sun had set
and the twilight darkened into night. Something
which, during that time, brought cruel smiles to his
lips, and made him glance round on either side at
the brush that marked the boundary of the Sioux
camping ground.</p>
<p>Something which at last made him rise from his
hard seat and fetch out his saddle from within the
hut. Then he brought his horse in from its tethering
ground, and saddled it, and rode off down to the
ford, and on to the tepee of old Big Wolf, the great
chief, the master mind that planned and carried out
all the bloody atrocities of the Pine Ridge Indian
risings.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Au revoir</i>, eh?&#8221; this tall renegade muttered, as
he dismounted before the smoke-begrimed dwelling.
&#8220;There&#8217;s only we two, Landor; and your precious
wife and child, and they are&mdash;no, we haven&#8217;t met
yet.&#8221; And he became silent as he raised the hide
door of the tepee, and, without announcing himself,
stepped within.</p>
<p>The dark, evil-smelling interior was lit only by
the smouldering embers of a small wood-fire in the
centre of the great circle. Though it was summer
these red heritors of the land could not do without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
their fire at night-time, any more than they could
do without their skins and frowsy blankets. Nevil
Steyne glanced swiftly over the dimly outlined faces
he saw looming in the shadows. The scene was a
familiar one to him, and each face he beheld was
familiar. The puffy, broad face of the great chief,
the fierce, aquiline features of the stripling who was
sitting beside him, and who was Big Wolf&#8217;s fifteen-year-old
son, and the dusky, delicate, high-caste
features of the old man&#8217;s lovely daughter, Wanaha.</p>
<p>He saw all these and entered in silence, leaving
his well-trained horse to its own devices outside. He
closed up the doorway behind him, and squatted
upon his haunches in their midst.</p>
<p>Big Wolf removed the long-stemmed, red-clay
pipe from his lips and held it out to the newcomer.
The newcomer took it while the other said &#8220;How.&#8221;
And all those about him followed suit and welcomed
the white man in chorus with this customary
greeting.</p>
<p>Then a conversation started which lasted far into
the night. It entailed much subtle argument on the
part of the visitor, and the introduction of many
dusky warriors into the tepee, who also smoked the
pipe in council, with many deliberate grunts of approval
at the words of wisdom the white adviser
spoke.</p>
<p>And all this was the result of that crested letter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>ON THE PLAINS</h3>
</div>

<p>There is no place in the world which affords
more cheerful solitude than the prairie. One may
be miles and miles away from human habitation and
yet there is an exhilaration in the very sunlight, in
the long nodding grass, in the dusty eddies of the
breeze which is never actually still on the plains. It
is the suggestion of freedom in a great boundless
space. It grips the heart, and one thanks God for
life. This effect is not only with the prairie novice.
It lasts for all time with those who once sniff the
scent of its delicious breath.</p>
<p>Dakota and the more southern Nebraska are not
the finest examples of the American plains, but they
will do. What is better they will make one ask for
more, and that is an excellent sign.</p>
<p>It is curious to gaze out over this wonderful virgin
grass-land and seek for signs of other human beings.
Not a speck in view, except perchance a grazing
steer or horse. Not a movement but the eddying
whirls of dust, and the nodding of the bowing grass
heads as they bend to the gentle pressure of the
lightest of zephyrs. And yet no doubt there are
human beings about; aye, even within half a mile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
For flat as those plains may seem they are really great
billows rolling away on every hand into the dim distance,
hiding men and cattle and houses in their
vast, open troughs.</p>
<p>A little party of six had just appeared over the
brow of a rising, which was the last great wave
toppling monstrously down toward that great expanse
of the shallow valley, in the midst of which
flows the Missouri. This tiny party, so meagre and
insufficient-looking as they faced the sun-bound
plains, had just left the river route to strike in a
more westerly direction. As they topped the rise
a great, wholesome love for the wide world about
them welled up in the heart of the woman who was
riding in the wagon, and found vent in a low, thrilling
exclamation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful!&#8221; Then louder and with eyes sparkling:
&#8220;Beautiful!&#8221;</p>
<p>A child of about eleven summers, with fair curling
ringlets flowing loosely beneath a wide, flat sun-hat,
whose wide-open violet eyes stared a little awe-struck
at the vast world which greeted them, nestled closer
to the woman&#8217;s side on the seat of the jolting wagon
without comment, but with a sharp little intake of
breath. She had no words to add to her mother&#8217;s.</p>
<p>At that moment one of three men riding ahead
detached himself from the others and dropped back
to the wagon, to speak to the woman and child. It
was easy to understand the relationship between
them by the affectionate smile that greeted him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
He was a tall man and much tanned by a life spent
largely in military camps in hot countries. He had
the well-set-up figure of a fighting soldier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dearie,&#8221; he said cheerfully to his wife, &#8220;how
do you like the prairie?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad we came on by road, Landor. The
hotel people were quite bothersome about the restlessness
of the Indians. I suppose that is a bogey
they thrust before all strangers. I am glad you did
not change your mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man understood his wife&#8217;s strong character,
and her reply made him feel as though his responsibilities
had been suddenly increased. He looked
at his companions riding in scout fashion in front.
They were pointing at something on the horizon,
and he followed the direction indicated.</p>
<p>At last he looked round and encountered the
gaze of his wife&#8217;s gray eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you would be, Al,&#8221; he said quietly.
&#8220;You see the Indians are always restless. Besides,
if I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man laughed happily.</p>
<p>&#8220;No not yet, dear. My secret must remain a little
longer. You are a wonder, Al. You have known
that I have a secret for nearly two months, and still
you refrain from questioning me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice shook her head, and stooped to readjust
their daughter&#8217;s hat. Her action hid the smile at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
her husband&#8217;s simplicity. A good wife learns many
things without questioning.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see I know I shall be told when it becomes
expedient. How would you like to make hay in
these lovely open fields, Marjorie?&#8221; she asked the
violet-eyed child, gazing so steadfastly at this new
world about her.</p>
<p>But Marjorie shook her head. She was a little
overpowered.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so big, mamma,&#8221; she murmured, doubtfully.</p>
<p>At that moment one of the two horsemen ahead
beckoned to the man a little peremptorily, and he
rode off. Then the child turned to her mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you mean about the Indians,
mamma?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the mother did not answer; she was watching
her husband, who had just joined the others, and she
saw that all three were watching something that
looked like smoke on the northwestern horizon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t Indians eat people, mamma?&#8221; asked the
child presently.</p>
<p>Her mother laughed shortly, and answered, &#8220;No.&#8221;
The answer came a little more sharply than she
usually spoke. Suddenly she leant forward and
touched the driver on the shoulder. He turned
round instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that smoke on the horizon, Jim?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>The man looked into her steady gray eyes. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
he glanced down at the beautiful child at her side,
and, in a moment, his gaze came back to the handsome
dark face of the mother; but instantly he turned
back to the horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he threw back brusquely over his
shoulder.</p>
<p>And the woman who learned so much without
asking questions knew that he lied.</p>
<p>The vehicle creaked on. The steady jog of the
horses kept the neck-yoke rattling in the harness
with a sound that was almost musical. The sun was
very hot, and the sweat was caked in white streaks
all over the hard-working animals&#8217; flanks. Mother
and child sat on in silence. Those two pairs of lovely
eyes were looking out ahead. The child interested,
and the mother thinking hard and swiftly. Curiously
that smoke on the horizon had set her thinking of
her husband and child, but mostly of the child. The
driver chirruped at his horses as he had done from
the start. He munched his tobacco, and seemed
quite at his ease. Only every now and then his
keen eyes lifted to the smoke. He was an old
prairie hand.</p>
<p>The horsemen on ahead had halted where a higher
billow of grass-land than usual had left a sharp, deep
hollow. A hundred yards to the right of the trail
there was a small clump of undergrowth. The men
had dismounted. When the wagon came up the
husband stepped to its side.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to camp here, Alice,&#8221; he said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
quietly. &#8220;There is good water close by. We can
spare the time; we have come along well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice glanced at the faces of the others while he
was speaking. One of the men was a long-haired
prairie scout; his keen black eyes were intent upon
her face. The other was a military &#8220;batman,&#8221; a
blue-eyed Yorkshireman. His eyes were very bright&mdash;unusually
bright. The teamster was placidly
looking round his horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she answered, and passed little
Marjorie out into her father&#8217;s arms. Then she
sprang lightly to the ground.</p>
<p>Then the teamster drove the horses away into the
brush, and the wagon was hidden from view. The
scout and the batman pitched two &#8220;A&#8221; tents, and
the mother noticed that they were so placed as to be
utterly hidden in the thick foliage. The horses were
off-saddled, and, contrary to custom, were tethered
further still from the road, down by the water.</p>
<p>Little Marjorie went off with the men who were
securing the horses, and Alice stood watching her
husband&#8217;s movements. She was a beautiful woman
of that strong, dark Celtic type, so common in
Ireland. Her strong supple figure was displayed to
perfection in a simple tweed suit with a jacket of the
Norfolk pattern. She stood for some moments
watching with deep contemplative eyes. Then she
abruptly turned away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will gather some fire-wood,&#8221; she said deliberately
to her husband.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>He looked up from his work and their eyes met.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother,&#8221; he said; &#8220;we will use the oil
stove.&#8221;</p>
<p>And without further explanation the camp was
arranged. There was no bustle or excitement. Yet
each member of that little party, with the exception
of the child, knew that the camp had been made in
emergency&mdash;grave emergency.</p>
<p>A hearty meal was partaken of. Then the man
and the scout disappeared. The others occupied
themselves around the camp. The afternoon wore
on. At tea the scout and his companion reappeared.
The wife still asked no verbal questions. Her eyes
told her all she wished to know.</p>
<p>During the evening meal little Marjorie made a
discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got a belt on
like daddy&#8217;s. What are these?&#8221; And she fingered
a revolver holster, of which her mother&#8217;s belt supported
two.</p>
<p>It was the rough, long-haired scout who saved the
woman a deliberate falsehood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess them&#8217;s playthings,&#8221; he said, with a sombre
laugh. &#8220;B&#8217;t don&#8217;t figger they&#8217;re fer kiddies to
monkey with.&#8221;</p>
<p>After supper the man and the scout again disappeared.
Three hours later the moon was high in
the starlit sky. It was a glorious summer moon,
and the whole country was bright with its silvery
light.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>Two men were lying upon their stomachs conning
the northwestern sky-line.</p>
<p>The scout at last spoke in his slow drawling way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess it&#8217;s played out, Colonel,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re
up agin it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t seem clear to what he referred, but the
other understood him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re working this way,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;See, something has been fired away to the right
front. They may be working round that way and
will miss us here. What are our chances?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nix,&#8221; responded the scout decidedly. &#8220;Them
critturs hev got to git around this way. They&#8217;re on
a line that&#8217;ll strike Fort Randall, wi&#8217; a heap more
military &#8217;n they&#8217;ll notion. They&#8217;ll strike south an&#8217;
sweep round sheer through to Wyoming. We&#8217;re
dead in their line.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;d best get back and prepare. Mrs.
Raynor and Marjorie will have turned in; we can
do it quietly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yup.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rose and returned to camp.</p>
<p>Colonel Raynor had intended to avoid his wife&#8217;s
tent. But Alice was waiting for him on the outskirts
of the camp. The scout saw her and discreetly
passed on, and husband and wife were left together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s tone was quite steady. She was
used to a soldier&#8217;s life. Besides, she understood
the man&#8217;s responsibility and wished to help him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
And Landor Raynor, looking into the gray eyes
that were to him the gates of the heart of purest
womanhood, could not resort to subterfuge.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will be on us before morning, dearest,&#8221; he
said, and it was only by the greatest effort he could
check a tide of self-accusation. But the woman
understood and quickly interposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feared so, Landor. Are you ready? I mean
for the fight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are preparing. I thought of sending you
and little Marjorie south with Jim, on saddle horses,
but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I would not go. I am what you men call
&#8216;useful with a gun.&#8217;&#8221; She laughed shortly.</p>
<p>There was a silence between them for some moments.
And in that silence a faint and distant sound
came to them. It was like the sound of droning
machinery, only very faint.</p>
<p>The wife broke the silence. &#8220;Landor, we are old
campaigners, you and I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Al.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman sighed ever so lightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The excitement of the foreknowledge of victory is
not in me to-night. Everything seems&mdash;so ordinary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When the moment comes, Landor, I should not
like to be taken prisoner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor shall you be, Al. There are four good
fighting men with you. All old campaigners like&mdash;you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I wasn&#8217;t thinking of that.&#8221; The gray eyes
looked away. The man shifted uneasily.</p>
<p>There was a prolonged silence. Each was thinking
over old scenes in old campaigns.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I am afraid of much,&#8221; the woman
said slowly, at last. &#8220;Certainly not of death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk like that, Al.&#8221; The man&#8217;s arm linked
itself through his wife&#8217;s. The woman smiled wistfully
up into the strong face bending over her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking, dearest, if death faced us, little
Marjorie and me, in any form, we should not like it
at the hands of an Indian. We should both prefer
it from some one we know and&mdash;love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another silence followed, and the sound of machinery
was nearer and louder. The man stooped
down and kissed the upturned face, and looked
long into the beautiful gray depths he loved so well.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shall be as you wish, Al&mdash;as a last resource.
I will go and kiss Marjorie. It is time we were
doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had spoken so quietly, so calmly. But in his
soldier&#8217;s heart he knew that his promise would be
carried out to the letter&mdash;as a last resource. He
left the woman, the old campaigner, examining the
revolvers which looked like cannons in her small
white hands.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>One brief hour has passed. The peace of that
lonely little trail-side camp has gone. War, a thousand
times more fierce than the war of civilized nations,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
is raging round it in the light of the summer
moon. The dead bodies of three white men are
lying within a few yards of the tent which belongs
to the ill-fated colonel and his wife. A horde of
shouting, shrieking savages encircle that little white
canopy and its two remaining defenders. Every
bush is alive with hideous painted faces waiting for
the last order to rush the camp. Their task has
been less easy than they supposed. For the defenders
were all &#8220;old hands.&#8221; And every shot from the
repeating rifles has told. But now it is different.
There are only two defenders left. A man of invincible
courage&mdash;and a woman; and behind them,
a little, awe-struck child in the doorway of the tent.</p>
<p>The echoing war-whoop sounds the final advance,
and the revolvers of those two desperate defenders
crack and crack again. The woman&#8217;s ammunition
is done. The man&#8217;s is nearly so. He turns, and she
turns to meet him. There is one swift embrace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; she says in a low, soft voice.</p>
<p>There is an ominous crack of a revolver, but it is
not fired in the direction of the Indians whom the
man sees are within a few yards of him. He sees the
woman fall, and turns swiftly to the tent door. The
child instinctively turns and runs inside. The man&#8217;s
gun is raised with inexorable purpose. His shot
rings out. The child screams; and the man crashes
to the earth with his head cleft by a hatchet from
behind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>AN ALARM IN BEACON CROSSING</h3>
</div>

<p>A horseman riding from White River Homestead
to Beacon Crossing will find himself confronted with
just eighty-two miles of dreary, flat trail; in summer
time, just eighty-two miles of blistering sun, dust and
mosquitoes. The trail runs parallel to, and about
three miles north of the cool, shady White River,
which is a tantalizing invention of those who designed
the trail.</p>
<p>In the whole eighty-two miles there is but one
wayside house; it is called the &#8220;half-way.&#8221; No one
lives there. It, like the log hut of Nevil Steyne on
the bank of the White River, stands alone, a relic of
the dim past. But it serves a good purpose, for one
can break the journey there, and sleep the night in
its cheerless shelter. Furthermore, within the ruins
of its old-time stockade is a well, a deep, wide-mouthed
well full of cool spring water, which is the
very thing needed.</p>
<p>It is sunrise and a horseman has just ridden away
from this shelter. He is a man of considerable
height, to judge by the length of his stirrups, and he
has that knack of a horseman in the saddle which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
comes only to those who have learned to ride as
soon as they have learned to run.</p>
<p>He wears fringed chapps over his moleskin trousers,
which give him an appearance of greater size
than he possesses, for, though stout of frame, he is
lean and wiry. His face is wonderfully grave for a
young man, which may be accounted for by the fact
that he has lived through several Indian risings.
And it is a strong face, too, with a decided look of
what people term self-reliance in it, also, probably,
a product of those dreaded Indian wars. He, like
many men who live through strenuous times, is
given much to quick thought and slow speech,
which, though excellent features in character, do not
help toward companionship in wild townships like
Beacon Crossing.</p>
<p>Seth is well thought of in that city&mdash;whither he is
riding now&mdash;but he is more respected than loved.
The truth is he has a way of liking slowly, and disliking
thoroughly, and this is a disposition the reckless
townsmen of Beacon Crossing fail to understand,
and, failing to understand, like most people, fail to
appreciate.</p>
<p>Just now he is more particularly grave than usual.
He has ridden from White River Farm to execute
certain business in town for his foster-parents, Rube
Sampson and his wife; a trifling matter, and certainly
nothing to bring that look of doubt in his eyes,
and the thoughtful pucker between his clean-cut
brows. His whole attention is given up to a contemplation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
of the land beyond the White River, and
the distance away behind him to the left, which is the
direction of the Rosebud Indian Reservation.</p>
<p>Yesterday his attention had been called in these
directions, and on reaching the &#8220;half-way&#8221; he had
serious thoughts of returning home, but reflection
had kept him to his journey if it had in no way eased
his mind.</p>
<p>Yesterday he had observed a smoky haze spreading
slowly northward on the lightest of breezes; and
it was coming across the Reservation. It was early
June, and the prairie was too young and green to
burn yet.</p>
<p>The haze was still hanging in the bright morning
air. It had spread right across his path in the night,
and a strong smell of burning greeted him as he rode
out.</p>
<p>He urged his horse and rode faster than he had
ridden the day before. There was a silent sympathy
between horse and rider which displayed itself in the
alertness of the animal&#8217;s manner; he was traveling
with head held high, nostrils distended, as though
sniffing at the smell of burning in some alarm.
And his gait, too, had become a little uneven, which,
in a horse, means that his attention is distracted.</p>
<p>Before an hour had passed the man&#8217;s look changed
to one of some apprehension. Smoke was rising in
a new direction. He had no need to turn to see it, it
was on his left front, far away beyond the horizon,
but somewhere where the railroad track, linking the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
East with Beacon Crossing, cut through the plains
of Nebraska. Suddenly his horse leapt forward
into a strong swinging gallop. He had felt the
touch of the spur. Seth pulled out a great silver
timepiece and consulted it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ken make it in two hours an&#8217; a haf from now,&#8221;
he muttered. &#8220;That&#8217;ll be haf past eight. Good!
Put it along, Buck.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last was addressed to the horse; and the dust
rose in great heavy clouds behind them as the willing
beast stretched out to his work.</p>
<p>Beacon Crossing is called a city by those residents
who have lived in it since the railway brought it into
existence. Chance travelers, and those who are not
prejudiced in its favor, call it a hole. It certainly has
claims in the latter direction. It is the section terminal
on the railway; and that is the source of its
questionable prosperity.</p>
<p>There is a main street parallel to the railroad track
with some stores facing the latter. It has only one
sidewalk and only one row of buildings; the other
side of the street is given up to piles of metal rails
and wooden ties and ballast for the track. The stores
are large fronted, with a mockery which would lead
the unenlightened to believe they are two-storied;
but this is make-believe. The upper windows have
no rooms behind them. They are the result of overweening
vanity on the part of the City Council and
have nothing to do with the storekeepers.</p>
<p>The place is unremarkable for anything else, unless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
it be the dirty and unpaved condition of its
street. True there are other houses, private residences,
but these are set indiscriminately upon the
surrounding prairie, and have no relation to any
roads. A row of blue gum trees marks the front of
each, and, for the most part, a clothes-line, bearing
some articles of washing, indicates the back. Beacon
Crossing would be bragged about only by those who
helped to make it.</p>
<p>The only building worth consideration is the hotel,
opposite the depot. This has a verandah and a tie-post,
and there are always horses standing outside
it, and always men standing on the verandah, except
when it is raining, then they are to be found inside.</p>
<p>It was only a little after eight in the morning.
Breakfast was nearly over in the hotel, and, to judge
by the number of saddle-horses at the tie-post, the
people of Beacon Crossing were very much astir.
Presently the verandah began to fill with hard-faced,
rough-clad men. And most of them as they came
were filling their pipes, which suggested that they
had just eaten.</p>
<p>Nevil Steyne was one of the earliest to emerge
from the breakfast room. He had been the last to
go in, and the moment he reappeared it was to survey
swiftly the bright blue distance away in the direction
of the Indian Reservations, and, unseen by those
who stood around, he smiled ever so slightly at what
he beheld. The two men nearest him were talking
earnestly, and their earnestness was emphasized by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
the number of matches they used in keeping their
pipes alight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them&#8217;s Injun fires, sure,&#8221; said one, at the conclusion
of a long argument.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they are, Dan,&#8221; said the other, an angular
man who ran a small hardware store a few yards
lower down the street. &#8220;But they ain&#8217;t on this side
of the Reservation anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>The significant selfishness of his last remark
brought the other round on him in a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all you care for, eh?&#8221; Dan said witheringly.
&#8220;Say. I&#8217;m working for the &#8216;diamond P&#8217;s,&#8217;
and they run their stock that aways. Hev you been
through one o&#8217; them Injun risings?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another man, stout and florid, Jack McCabe, the
butcher, joined them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t make it out. There ain&#8217;t been any Sun-dance,
which is usual &#8217;fore they get busy. Guess it
ain&#8217;t no rising. Big Wolf&#8217;s too clever. If it was
spring round-up or fall round-up it &#8217;ud seem more
likely. Guess some feller&#8217;s been and fired the woods.
Which, by the way, is around Jason&#8217;s farm. Say,
Dan Lawson, you living that way, ain&#8217;t it right that
Jason&#8217;s got a couple of hundred beeves in his
corrals?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Dan of the &#8220;diamond P&#8217;s.&#8221; &#8220;He
bought up the &#8217;flying S&#8217; stock. He&#8217;s holding &#8217;em
up for rebrandin&#8217;. Say, Nevil,&#8221; the cowpuncher
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
went on, turning to the wood-cutter of White River,
&#8220;you oughter know how them red devils is doin&#8217;.
Did you hear or see anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil turned with a slight flush tingeing his
cheeks. He didn&#8217;t like the other&#8217;s tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why I should know or see anything,&#8221;
he said shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, you&#8217;re kind o&#8217; livin&#8217; ad-jacent, as the sayin&#8217;
is,&#8221; observed Dan, with a shadowy smile.</p>
<p>The other men on the verandah had come around,
and they smiled more broadly than the cowpuncher.
It was easy to see that they were not particularly
favorable toward Nevil Steyne. It was as Dan had
said; he lived near the Reservation, and, well, these
men were frontiersmen who knew the ways of the
country in which they lived.</p>
<p>Nevil saw the smiling faces and checked his anger.
He laughed instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;since you set such store by my
opinions I confess I had no reason to suspect any
disturbance, and, to illustrate my faith in the Indians&#8217;
peaceful condition, I am going home at noon, and
to-morrow intend to cut a load or two of wood on
the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan had no more to say. He could have said
something but refrained, and the rest of the men
turned to watch the white smoke in the distance.
Decidedly Steyne had scored a point and should
have been content; but he wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you fellows think a white man can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
live near Indians without &#8216;taking the blanket,&#8217;&#8221; he
pursued with a sneer.</p>
<p>There was a brief silence. Then Dan answered
him slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest depends on the man, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a nasty tone in the cowpuncher&#8217;s voice
and trouble seemed imminent, but it was fortunately
nipped in the bud by Jack McCabe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; the butcher exclaimed excitedly,
&#8220;there&#8217;s a feller pushin&#8217; his plug as tho&#8217; them
Injuns was on his heels. Say, it&#8217;s Seth o&#8217; White
River Farm, and by the gait he&#8217;s travelin&#8217;, I&#8217;d gamble,
Nevil, you don&#8217;t cut that wood to-morrow. Seth
don&#8217;t usually ride hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole attention on the verandah was centred
on Seth, who was riding toward the hotel from across
the track as hard as his horse could lay foot to the
ground.</p>
<p>In a few moments he drew up at the tie-post and
flung off his horse. And a chorus of inquiry greeted
him from the bystanders.</p>
<p>The newcomer raised an undisturbed face to them,
and his words came without any of the excitement
that the pace he had ridden in at had suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Injuns are out,&#8221; he said, and bent down to
feel his horse&#8217;s legs. They seemed to be of most
interest to him at the moment.</p>
<p>Curiously enough his words were accepted by the
men on the verandah without question. That is, by
all except Steyne. No doubt he was irritated by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
what had gone before, but even so, it hardly warranted,
in face of the fires in the south, his obstinate
refusal to believe that the Indians were out on the
war-path. Besides, he resented the quiet assurance of
the newcomer. He resented the manner in which
the others accepted his statement, disliking it as
much as he disliked the man who had made it. Nor
was the reason of this hatred far to seek. Seth was
a loyal white man who took his life in his own hands
and fought strenuously in a savage land for his existence,
a bold, fearless frontiersman; while he,
Nevil, knew in his secret heart that he had lost that
caste, had thrown away that right&mdash;that birthright.
He had, as these men also knew, &#8220;taken the
blanket.&#8221; He had become a white Indian. He
lived by the clemency of that people, in their manner,
their life. He was one of them, while yet his
skin was white. He was regarded by his own race
as an outcast. He was a degenerate. So he hated&mdash;hated
them all. But Seth he hated most of all
because he saw more of him, he lived near him. He
knew that Seth knew him, knew him down to his
heart&#8217;s core. This was sufficient in a nature like his
to set him hating, but he hated him for yet another
reason. Seth was as strong, brave, honest as he was
the reverse. He belonged to an underworld which
nothing could ever drag a nature such as Seth&#8217;s
down to.</p>
<p>He knocked his pipe out aggressively on the
wooden floor of the verandah.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; he said loudly, in an offensive
way.</p>
<p>Seth dropped his broncho&#8217;s hoof, which he had
been examining carefully, and turned round. It
would be impossible to describe the significance of
his movement. It suggested the sudden rousing of
a real fighting dog that had been disturbed in some
peaceful pursuit. He was not noisy, he did not even
look angry. He was just ready.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you ought to know, Nevil Steyne,&#8221;
he said with emphasis. Then he turned his head
and looked away down the street, as the clatter
of hoofs and rattle of wheels reached the hotel.
And for the second time within a few minutes,
trouble, such as only Western men fully understand,
was staved off by a more important interruption.</p>
<p>A team and buckboard dashed up to the hotel.
Dan Somers, the sheriff, and Lal Price, the Land
Agent, were in the conveyance, and as they drew
up, one of the horses dropped to the ground in its
harness. The men, watching these two plainsmen
scrambling from the vehicle, knew that life and death
alone could have sent them into town at a pace sufficient
to kill one of their horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys!&#8221; cried the sheriff at once. &#8220;Who&#8217;s for
it? Those durned Injuns are out; they&#8217;re gittin&#8217;
round Jason&#8217;s place. I&#8217;m not sure but the woods are
fired a&#8217;ready. They&#8217;ve come from the south, I guess.
They&#8217;re Rosebuds. Ther&#8217;s old man Jason and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
missis; and ther&#8217;s the gals&mdash;three of &#8217;em. We can&#8217;t
let &#8217;em&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth interrupted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we ain&#8217;t going to,&#8221; he observed. He knew,
they all knew, what the sheriff would have said.</p>
<p>Seth&#8217;s interruption was the cue for suggestions.
And they came with a rush, which is the way with
men such as these, all eager and ready to help in the
rescue of a white family from the hands of a common
foe. There was no hesitation, for they were most of
them old hands in this Indian business, and, in the
back recesses of their brains, each man held recollections
of past atrocities, too hideous to be contemplated
calmly.</p>
<p>Those who were later with their breakfast now
swelled the crowd on the verandah. The news
seemed to have percolated through to the rest of the
town, for men were gathering on all sides, just as
men gather in civilized cities on receipt of news of
national importance. They came at once to the
central public place. The excitement had leapt with
the suddenness of a conflagration, and, like a conflagration,
there would be considerable destruction
before it died down. The Indians in their savage
temerity might strike Beacon Crossing. Once the
Indians were loose it was like the breaking of a tidal
wave on a low shore.</p>
<p>The sheriff was the man they all looked to, and,
veteran warrior that he was, he quickly got a grip on
things. One hard-riding scout, a man as wily as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
Indian himself, he despatched to warn all outlying
settlers. He could spare no more than one. Then
he sent telegraphic messages for the military, whose
fort a progressive and humane government had
located some two hundred miles away. Then he
divided his volunteers, equipped with their own
arms, and all the better for that, and detailed one
party for the town&#8217;s defence, and the other to join
him in the work of rescue.</p>
<p>These things arranged, then came the first check.
It was discovered that the driver of the only locomotive
in the place was sick. The engine itself, a
rusty looking ancient machine, was standing coldly
idle in the yards.</p>
<p>A deputation waited upon the sick man, while
others went and coupled up some empty trucks and
fired the engine. Seth was among the latter. The
deputation returned. It was fever; and the man
could not come. Being ready campaigners, their
thoughts turned on their horses.</p>
<p>The sheriff was a blank man for the moment. It
was a question of time, he knew. He was standing
beside the locomotive which had already begun to
snort, and which looked, at that moment, in the eyes
of those gathered round it, despite its rustiness, a
truly magnificent proposition. He was about to call
for volunteers to replace the driver, when Seth, who
all the time had been working in the cab, and who
had heard the news of the trouble, leant over the rail
that protected the foot-plate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Dan,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If none of the boys are
scared to ride behind me, and I don&#8217;t figger they
are, I&#8217;ll pump the old kettle along. Guess I&#8217;ve fired
a traction once. I don&#8217;t calc&#8217;late she&#8217;ll have time to
bust up in forty miles. I&#8217;ll take the chances if they
will.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff looked up at the thoughtful face above
him. He grinned, and others grinned with him.
But their amusement was quite lost on Seth. He
was trying to estimate the possible result of putting
the &#8220;kettle,&#8221; as he called the locomotive, at full
steam ahead, disregarding every other tap and gauge
on the driving plate, and devoting himself to heaping
up the furnace. These things interested him,
not as a source of danger, but only in the matter of
speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you, Seth,&#8221; cried Dan Somers. &#8220;Now,
boys, all aboard!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Seth turned to the driving plate and sounded
a preliminary whistle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>ROSEBUD</h3>
</div>

<p>It is nearly midday, and the Indians round the
blazing woods on the southern spur of the Black
Hills are in full retreat. Another desperate battle,
such as crowd the unwritten history of the United
States, has been fought and won. The history of
the frontiersman&#8217;s life would fill a record which any
soldier might envy. It is to the devotion of such
men that colonial empires owe their being, for without
their aid, no military force could bring peace and
prosperity to a land. The power of the sword may
conquer and hold, but there its mission ends. It is
left to the frontiersman to do the rest.</p>
<p>The battle-field is strewn with dead and dying;
but there are no white faces staring blankly up at
the heavens, only the painted, seared features of the
red man. Their opponents are under cover. If they
have any dead or dying they are with the living.
These men fight in the manner of the Indian, but
with a superior intelligence.</p>
<p>But though the white men have won the battle
their end is defeated. For the blazing woods have
swept across the homestead of &#8220;old man&#8221; Jason, for
years a landmark in the country, and now it is no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
more. A mere charred skeleton remains; smoking,
smouldering, a witness to the white man&#8217;s daring in
a savage country.</p>
<p>The blazing woods are approachable only on the
windward side, and even here the heat is blistering.
It is still impossible to reach the ruins of the homestead,
for the wake of the fire is like a superheated
oven. And so the men who came to succor have
done the only thing left for them. They have fought
and driven off the horde of Indians, who first sacked
the ranch and then fired it. But the inmates; and
amongst them four women. What of them? These
rough plainsmen asked themselves this question as
they approached the conflagration; then they shut
their teeth hard and meted out a terrible chastisement
before pushing their inquiries further. It was
the only way.</p>
<p>A narrow river skirts the foot of the hills, cutting
the homestead off from the plains. And along its
bank, on the prairie side, is a scattered brush such as is
to be found adjacent to most woods. The fire has
left it untouched except that the foliage is much
scorched, and it is here that the victors of an unrecorded
battle lie hidden in the cover. Though the
enemy is in full retreat, and the rearmost horsemen
are fast diminishing against the horizon, not a man
has left his shelter. They are men well learned in
the craft of the Indians.</p>
<p>Dan Somers and Seth are sharing the same cover.
The sheriff is watching the last of the braves as they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
desperately hasten out of range. At last he moves
and starts to rise from his prone position. But
Seth&#8217;s strong hand checks him and pulls him down
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the sheriff yielded nevertheless. In spite of
his fledgling twenty-two years, Seth was an experienced
Indian fighter, and Dan Somers knew it; no
one better. Seth&#8217;s father and mother had paid the
life penalty seventeen years ago at the hands of the
Cheyennes. It was jokingly said that Seth was a
white Indian. By which those who said it meant
well but put it badly. He certainly had remarkable
native instincts.</p>
<p>&#8220;This heat is hellish!&#8221; Somers protested presently,
as Seth remained silent, gazing hard at a
rather large bluff on the river bank, some three
hundred yards ahead. Then he added bitterly,
&#8220;But it ain&#8217;t no use. We&#8217;re too late. The fire&#8217;s
finished everything. Maybe we&#8217;ll find their bodies.
I guess their scalps are elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth turned. He began to move out of his cover
in Indian fashion, wriggling through the grass like
some great lizard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back in a whiles,&#8221; he said, as he went.
&#8220;Stay right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was back in a few minutes. No Indian could
have been more silent in his movements.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; questioned the sheriff.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>Seth smiled in his own gradual manner. &#8220;We&#8217;re
going to draw &#8217;em, I guess,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Fill up.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the two men recharged the magazines of
their Winchesters.</p>
<p>Presently Seth pointed silently at the big bluff on
the river bank. The next moment he had fired into
it, and his shot was followed at once by a perfect hail
of lead from the rest of the hidden white men. The
object of his recent going was demonstrated.</p>
<p>For nearly two minutes the fusilade continued, then
Seth&#8217;s words were proved. There was a rush and
scrambling and breaking of brush. Thirty mounted
braves dashed out of the hiding and charged the
white men&#8217;s cover. It was only to face a decimating
fire. Half the number were unhorsed, and the riderless
ponies fled in panic in the direction of those who
had gone before.</p>
<p>But while others headed these howling, painted
fiends Seth&#8217;s rifle remained silent. He knew that this
wild rush was part of a deliberate plan, and he waited
for the further development. It came. His gun
leapt to his shoulder as a horse and rider darted out
of the brush. The man made eastward, attempting
escape under cover of his staunch warriors&#8217; desperate
feint. Seth had him marked down. He was the
man of all whom he had looked for. But the aim
had to be careful, for he was carrying a something
that looked like woman&#8217;s clothes in his arms, and,
besides, this man must not go free. Seth was very
deliberate at all times; now he was particularly so.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
And when the puff of smoke passed from the muzzle
of his rifle it was to be seen that the would-be fugitive
had fallen, and his horse had gone on riderless.</p>
<p>Now the few remaining braves broke and fled,
but there was no escape for them. They had defeated
their own purpose by approaching too close.
Not one was left to join the retreating band. It was
a desperate slaughter.</p>
<p>The fight was done. Seth left his cover, and,
followed by the sheriff, went across to where the
former&#8217;s victim had fallen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; exclaimed Somers, as they came up.
&#8220;It is Big Wolf&mdash;&mdash; What?&#8221; He broke off and
dropped to his knees.</p>
<p>But Seth was before him. The latter had dragged
the body of the great chief to one side, and revealed,
to the sheriff&#8217;s astonished eyes, the dainty
clothing, and what looked like the dead form of a
white girl child. They both held the same thought,
but Somers was the first to put it into words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tain&#8217;t Jason&#8217;s. They&#8217;re all grown up,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>Seth was looking down at the child&#8217;s beautiful
pale face. His eyes took in the thick, fair ringlets
of flowing hair all matted with blood. He noted
even the texture of the clothes. And, suddenly
stooping, he gathered her into his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s mine now,&#8221; he said. Then his thoughtful,
dark eyes took on their slow smile again. &#8220;And
she ain&#8217;t dead, though pretty nigh, I&#8217;m thinking.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you know?&#8221; asked Somers curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say. I&#8217;ve jest a notion that aways.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others came up, but not another word passed
Seth&#8217;s lips. He walked off in the direction of the
track where the engine was standing at the head of
its trucks. And by the time he reached his destination
he was quite weighted down, for this prize of
his was no infant but a girl of some years. He
laid her tenderly in the cab of the engine, and
quickly discovered a nasty scalp wound on the back
of her head. Just for a moment he conceived it to
be the result of his own shot, then he realized that
the injury was not of such recent infliction. Nevertheless
it was the work of a bullet; which discovery
brought forth a flow of scathing invective upon the
head of the author of the outrage.</p>
<p>With that care which was so characteristic of this
thoughtful plainsman, he fetched water from the
tank of the locomotive, tore off a large portion of
his own flannel shirt, and proceeded to wash the
wound as tenderly as might any devoted mother.
He was used to a rough treatment of wounds, and,
by the time he had bandaged the pretty head, he
found that his supply of shirt was nearly exhausted.
But this in no way disturbed him.</p>
<p>With great resource he went back to the prairie
and tore out great handfuls of the rank grass, and so
contrived a comparatively luxurious couch for his
foundling on the foot-plate of the engine.</p>
<p>By this time the men were returning from their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
search for the bodies at the ruins of the ranch. The
story was quickly told. The remains had been
found, as might have been expected, charred cinders
of bone.</p>
<p>There was no more to be done here, and Somers,
on his return to the track, sounded the true note of
their necessity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must git back. Them durned Injuns &#8217;ll
make tracks fer Beacon Crossing, or I&#8217;m a Dago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he looked into the cab where the still form
of the prairie waif lay shaded by a piece of tarpaulin
which Seth had found on the engine. He observed
the bandage and the grass bed, and he looked at
the figure bending to the task of firing.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you goin&#8217; to do with her?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Seth worked on steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll hand her over to Ma Sampson,&#8221; he
said, without turning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe she has folks. Maybe ther&#8217;s the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth turned now.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s mine now,&#8221; he cried over his shoulder.
Then he viciously aimed a shovelful of coal at the
open furnace door.</p>
<p>All his years of frontier life had failed to change a
naturally tender heart in Seth. Whatever he might
do in the heat of swift-rising passion it had no
promptings in his real nature. The life of the plains
was his in all its varying moods, but there was an
unchanging love for his kind under it all. However,
like all such men, he hated to be surprised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
into a betrayal of these innermost feelings, and
this is what had happened. Somers had found the
vulnerable point in his armor of reserve, but, like
the sensible man he was, he kept his own counsel.</p>
<p>At the saloon in Beacon Crossing the men were
less careful. Their curiosity found vent in questionable
pleasantries, and they chaffed Seth in a rough,
friendly way.</p>
<p>On their arrival Seth handed the still unconscious
child over to the wife of the hotel-keeper for an examination
of her clothes. He did this at Dan
Somers&#8217; suggestion, as being the most legal course
to pursue, and waited with the sheriff and several
others in the bar for the result.</p>
<p>Good news had greeted the fighting party on their
return. The troops were already on the way to
suppress the sudden and unaccountable Indian
rising. Eight hundred of the hard-riding United
States cavalry had left the fort on receipt of the
message from Beacon Crossing. The hotel-keeper
imparted the news with keen appreciation; he had
no desire for troublesome times. Plainsmen had a
knack of quitting his execrable drink when there
was fighting to be done&mdash;and Louis Roiheim was
an Israelite.</p>
<p>A silence fell upon the bar-room on the appearance
of Julie Roiheim. She saw Seth, and beckoned
him over to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are initials on the little one&#8217;s clothing.
M. R.,&#8221; she said. And Seth nodded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Any name?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>The stout old woman shook her greasy head.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s no ordinary child, Seth. Not by a lot.
She belongs East, or my name&#8217;s not Julie. That
child is the girl of some millionaire in Noo York, or
Philadelphy. She&#8217;s got nothing on her but what is
fine lawn and <i>real</i> lace!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; murmured the plainsman, without any responsive
enthusiasm, while his dark eyes watched the
triumphant features of the woman to whom these
things were of such consequence. &#8220;And has the
Doc. got around?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s fixin&#8217; her up,&#8221; Julie Roiheim went on.
&#8220;Oh, yes, you were right, she&#8217;s alive, but he can&#8217;t
wake her up. He says if she&#8217;s to be moved, it had
best be at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221; Just for one brief instant Seth&#8217;s thoughtful
face lit up. He turned to old Louis. &#8220;Guess
I&#8217;ll borrow your buckboard,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
need it to take the kiddie out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hotel-keeper nodded, and just then Nevil
Steyne, who at that moment had entered the
bar, and had only gleaned part of the conversation,
made his way over to where Seth was standing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is she?&#8221; he asked, fixing his cold blue
eyes eagerly on the face of the man he was addressing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Seth shortly. Then as an afterthought,
&#8220;Clothes marked M. R.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>The blue eyes lowered before the other&#8217;s steady
gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; murmured Nevil. Then he, too, paused.
&#8220;Is she alive?&#8221; he asked at last. And there was
something in his tone which suggested a dry throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she is,&#8221; replied Seth. &#8220;And,&#8221; he said, with
unusual expansiveness, &#8220;I guess she&#8217;ll keep right on
doing that same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth had again betrayed himself.</p>
<p>Nevil seemed half inclined to say more. But Seth
gave him no chance. He had no love for this man.
He turned on his heel without excuse and left the
hotel to attend to the preparation of the buckboard
himself.</p>
<p>On his way home that afternoon, and all the next
day, the Indians were in his thoughts only so far as
this waif he had picked up was concerned. For the
most part he was thinking of the child herself, and
those to whom he was taking her. He pictured the
delight with which his childless foster-parents would
receive her. The bright-faced little woman whom he
affectionately called &#8220;Ma&#8221;; the massive old plainsman,
Rube, with his gurgling chuckle, gruff voice
and kindly heart. And his thoughts stirred in him
an emotion he never would have admitted. He
thought of the terrible lot he had saved this child
from, for he knew only too well why she had been
spared by the ruthless Big Wolf.</p>
<p>All through that long journey his watchfulness
never relaxed. He looked to the comfort of his patient
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
although she was still unconscious. He protected
her face from the sun, and kept cool cloths
upon her forehead, and drove only at a pace which
spared the inanimate body unnecessary jolting. And
it was all done with an eye upon the Reservations
and horizon; with a hearing always acute on the
prairie, rendered doubly so now, and with a loaded
rifle across his knees.</p>
<p>It was dusk when he drove up to the farm. A
certain relief came over him as he observed the
peaceful cattle grazing adjacent to the corrals, the
smoke rising from the kitchen chimney, and the
great figure of Rube smoking reflectively in the
kitchen doorway.</p>
<p>He did not stop to unhitch the horses, just hooking
them to the corral fence. Then he lifted the
child from the buckboard and bore her to the house.</p>
<p>Rube watched him curiously as he came with his
burden. There was no greeting between these two.
Both were usually silent men, but for different reasons.
Conversation was a labor to Rube; a twinkling
look of his deep-set eyes, and an expressive
grunt generally contented him. Now he removed
his pipe from his lips and stared in open-mouthed
astonishment at the queer-looking bundle Seth was
carrying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; he muttered. And made way for his foster
son. Any questions that might have occurred to
him were banished from his slow-moving thoughts.</p>
<p>Seth laid his charge upon the kitchen table, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
Rube looked at the deathlike face, so icy, yet so
beautiful. A great broad smile, not untouched with
awe, spread over his bucolic features.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Ma?&#8221; asked Seth.</p>
<p>Rube indicated the ceiling with the stem of his pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma,&#8221; cried Seth, through the doorway, up the
narrow stairs which led to the rooms above. &#8220;Come
right down. Guess I&#8217;ve kind o&#8217; got a present for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That you, Seth?&#8221; called out a cheery voice from
above.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess so.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment later a little woman, with gray hair and
a face that might have belonged to a woman of thirty,
bustled into the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Seth,&#8221; she cried affectionately, &#8220;you jest set
to it to spoil your old mother.&#8221; Then her eyes fell
on the figure on the kitchen table. &#8220;La sakes, boy,
what&#8217;s&mdash;what&#8217;s this?&#8221; Then as she bent over the
unconscious child. &#8220;Oh, the pore&mdash;pore little
beauty!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rube turned away with a chuckle. His practical
little wife had been astonished out of her wits. And
the fact amused him immensely.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a gal, Ma,&#8221; said Seth. He too was smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious, boy, guess I&#8217;ve got two eyes in my
head!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long pause. Ma fingered the silken
curls. Then she took one of the cold hands in hers
and stroked it softly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where&mdash;where did you git her?&#8221; she asked at
last.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Injuns. I shot Big Wolf yesterday.
They&#8217;re on the war-path.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221; The bright-eyed woman looked up at this
tall foster son of hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;War-path&mdash;you shot Big Wolf?&#8221; cried Rube,
now roused to unwonted speech. &#8220;Then we&#8217;d best
git busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, father,&#8221; Seth reassured him. &#8220;The
troops are on the trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was another considerable pause while all
eyes were turned on the child. At last Mrs. Sampson
looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is she?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>Seth shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. Maybe she&#8217;s yours&mdash;an&#8217; mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know wher&#8217; she come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Seth shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; what&#8217;s her name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say&mdash;leastways her initials are M. R. You
see I got her from&mdash;there that&#8217;s it. I got her from
the Rosebuds. That&#8217;s her name. Rosebud!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A BIRTHDAY GIFT</h3>
</div>

<p>Rosebud struggled through five long months of
illness after her arrival at White River Farm. It
was only the untiring care of Rube and his wife,
and Seth, that pulled her through. The wound
at the base of the skull had affected her brain as
well as body, and, until the last moment when she
finally awoke to consciousness, her case seemed
utterly without hope.</p>
<p>But when at last her convalescence came it was
marvelously rapid. It was not until the good old
housewife began to question her patient that the full
result of the cruel blow on her head was realized.
Then it was found that she had no recollection of any
past. She knew not who she was, her name, her
age, even her nationality. She had a hazy idea of
Indians, which, as she grew stronger, became more
pronounced, until she declared that she must have
lived among Indians all her life.</p>
<p>It was this last that roused Seth to a sense of what
he conceived to be his duty. And with that deliberateness
which always characterized him, he set about
it at once. From the beginning, after his first great
burst of pitying sorrow for the little waif, when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
had clasped her in his arms and almost fiercely
claimed her for his own, his treasure trove, he had
realized that she belonged to some other world than
his own. This thought stayed with him. It slumbered
during the child&#8217;s long illness, but roused to
active life when he discovered that she had no
knowledge of herself. Therefore he set about inquiries.
He must find out to whom she belonged
and restore her to her people.</p>
<p>There was no one missing for two hundred miles
round Beacon Crossing except the Jasons. It was
impossible that the Indians could have gone farther
afield, for they had not been out twenty-four hours
when Rosebud was rescued. So his search for the
child&#8217;s friends proved unavailing.</p>
<p>Still, from that day on he remained loyal to her.
Any clue, however frail, was never too slight for him
to hunt to its source. He owed it to her to restore
her to her own, whatever regret it might cost him
to lose her. He was not the man to shirk a painful
duty, certainly not where his affections were concerned.</p>
<p>During the six years, while Rosebud was growing
to womanhood, Seth&#8217;s hands were very full. Those
wonderful violet eyes belonged to no milk and water
&#8220;miss.&#8221; From the very beginning the girl proved
herself spirited and wilful. Not in any vicious way.
A &#8220;madcap&#8221; best describes her. She had no
thought of consequences; only the delight of the
moment, the excitement and risk. These were the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
things that plunged her into girlish scrapes from
which it fell to the lot of Seth to extricate her. All
her little escapades were in themselves healthy
enough, but they were rarely without a smack of
physical danger.</p>
<p>She began when she learned to ride, a matter which
of course devolved upon Seth.</p>
<p>Once she could sit a wild, half-tamed broncho her
career in the direction of accident became checkered.
Once, after a day&#8217;s search for her, Seth brought her
home insensible. She had been thrown from her
horse, an animal as wildly wilful as herself.</p>
<p>A little private target practice with a revolver resulted
in the laming of a cow, and the killing of a
chicken, and in nearly terminating Rube&#8217;s career,
when he ran out of the house to ascertain the meaning
of the firing. Once she was nearly drowned in
the White River, while bathing with the Indian children
after service at the Mission. She was never free
from the result of childish recklessness. And this
feature of her character grew with her, though her
achievements moderated as the years passed.</p>
<p>It was by these wild means that she endeared herself
to the folks on the farm. Seth&#8217;s love grew apace.
He made no attempt to deceive himself. He loved
her as a child, and that love changed only in its nature
when she became a woman. He made no attempt
to check it. He knew she was not for him;
never could be. He, a rough, half-educated plainsman;
she, a girl who displayed, even in her most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
reckless moods, that indelible stamp which marked
the disparity between the social worlds to which they
belonged. He was convinced, without disparaging
himself, that to attempt to win her would be an outrage,
an imposition on her. Worse, it would be
rankly dishonest.</p>
<p>So the man said nothing. All that lay within his
heart he kept hidden far out of sight. No chance
word or weak moment should reveal it. No one
should ever know, least of all Rosebud.</p>
<p>But in all this Seth reckoned without his host.
Such glorious eyes, such a charming face as Rosebud
possessed were not likely to belong to a girl devoid
of the instincts of her sex. As she grew up her perspective
changed. She saw things in a different light.
Seth no longer appealed to her as a sort of uncle, or
even father. She saw in him a young man of medium
good looks, a strong, fine figure. A man who
had no idea of the meaning of the word fear; a man
who had a way of saying and doing things which
often made her angry, but always made her glad that
he said and did them. Furthermore, she soon learned
that he was only twenty-eight. Therefore, she resented
many things which she had hitherto accepted
as satisfactory. She made up her wilful mind that
it didn&#8217;t please her to call him &#8220;Daddy&#8221; Seth any
longer.</p>
<p>Those six years brought another change; a change
in the life of the wood-cutter of White River. He
still lived in his log hut, but he had taken to himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
a wife, the beautiful orphaned daughter of Big Wolf,
and sister of the reigning chief, Little Black Fox.
Whatever may have been Nevil Steyne&#8217;s position
before, he was completely ostracized by his fellows
now, that is by all but the folk at White River Farm.
Men no longer suggested that he had &#8220;taken the
blanket&#8221;; they openly asserted it.</p>
<p>The reason of Nevil Steyne&#8217;s toleration by the
White River Farm people was curious. It was for
Rosebud&#8217;s sake; Rosebud and Wanaha, the wife of
the renegade wood-cutter. The latter was different
from the rest of her race. She was almost civilized,
a woman of strong, honest character in spite of her
upbringing. And between Rosebud and this squaw
a strong friendship had sprung up. Kindly Rube
and his wife could not find it in their hearts to interfere,
and even Seth made no attempt to check it.
He looked on and wondered without approval; and
wonder with him quickly turned into keen observation.</p>
<p>And it is with this strange friendship that we have
to deal now.</p>
<p>Inside the log hut on the White River, Wanaha
was standing before a small iron cook-stove preparing
her husband&#8217;s food. It was the strangest sight imaginable
to see her cooking in European fashion.
Yet she did it in no uncertain manner. She learned
it all because she loved her white husband, just as
she learned to speak English, and to dress after the
manner of white women. She went further. With
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
the assistance of the missionary and Rosebud she
learned to read and sew, and to care for a house.
And all this labor of a great love brought her the
crowning glory of legitimate wifehood with a renegade
white man, and the care of a dingy home that
no white girl would have faced. But she was happy.
Happy beyond all her wildest dreams in the smoke-begrimed
tepee of her father.</p>
<p>Nevil Steyne had just returned from Beacon Crossing,
whither he had gone to sell a load of cord-wood,
and to ask for mail at the post-office. Strange as it
may seem, this man still received letters from England.
But to-day he had returned with only a packet
of newspapers.</p>
<p>He entered the hut without notice or greeting for
Wanaha, who, in true Indian fashion, waited by the
cook-stove for her lord to speak first.</p>
<p>He passed over to the bedstead which occupied
the far end of the room, and sat himself down to a
perusal of his papers. He was undoubtedly preoccupied
and not intentionally unkind to the woman.</p>
<p>Wanaha went steadily on with her work. For her
this was quite as it should be. He would speak presently.
She was satisfied.</p>
<p>Presently the man flung his papers aside, and the
woman&#8217;s deep eyes met his as he looked across at
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Wana,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve sold the wood and
got orders for six more cords. Business is booming.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man spoke in English. Yet he spoke Wanaha&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
tongue as fluently as she did herself. Here
again the curious submissive nature of the woman
was exampled. He must speak his own tongue.
It was not right that he should be forced to use
hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am much happy,&#8221; she said simply. Then her
woman&#8217;s thought rose superior to greater issues.
&#8220;You will eat?&#8221; she went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Wana. I&#8217;m hungry&mdash;very.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So.&#8221; The woman&#8217;s eyes smiled into his, and
she eagerly set the food on a table made of packing
cases.</p>
<p>Steyne began at once. He was thoughtful while he
ate. But after a while he looked up, and there was a
peculiar gleam in his blue eyes as they rested on the
warm, rich features of his willing slave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty poor sort of place&mdash;this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
not good enough for you, my Wana.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman had seated herself on a low stool
near the table. It was one of her few remaining
savage instincts she would not give up. It was not
fitting that she should eat with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you like a house, a big house, like&mdash;White
River Farm?&#8221; he went on, as though he were
thinking aloud. &#8220;And hundreds, thousands, of
steers and cows? And buggies to ride in? And
farm machinery? And&mdash;and plenty of fine clothes
to wear, like&mdash;like Rosebud?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman shook her head and indicated her
humble belongings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This&mdash;very good. Very much good. See, you
are here. I want you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man flushed and laughed a little awkwardly.
But he was well pleased.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re happy enough. You and I, my Wana.
But&mdash;we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wanaha made no comment; and when his meat
was finished she set a dish of buckwheat cakes and
syrup before him.</p>
<p>He devoured them hungrily, and the woman&#8217;s
eyes grew soft with delight at his evident pleasure.</p>
<p>At last his thoughtfulness passed, and he put an
abrupt question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your brother, now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Black Fox is by his tepee. He goes hunting
with another sun. Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go and see him this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Steyne pushed his plate away, and proceeded to
fill his pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>The expressive eyes of the woman had changed
again. His announcement seemed to give her little
pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have things to pow-wow with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah. Rosebud? Always Rosebud?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;My Wana does not like Little Black Fox to
think of Rosebud, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wanaha was silent for a while. Then she spoke
in a low tone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Little Black Fox is not wise. He is very fierce.
No, I love my brother, but Rosebud must not be his
squaw. I love Rosebud, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The blue eyes of the man suddenly became very
hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big Wolf captured Rosebud, and would have
kept her for your brother. Therefore she is his by
right of war. Indian war. This Seth kills your
father. He says so. He takes Rosebud. Is it
for him to marry her? Your brother does not think
so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wanaha&#8217;s face was troubled. &#8220;It was in war.
You said yourself. My brother could not hold her
from the white man. Then his right is gone. Besides&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A chief may not marry a white girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You married a white man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is different.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence for some time while Wanaha
cleared away the plates. Presently, as she was
bending over the cook-stove, she spoke again. And
she kept her face turned from her husband while she
spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want Rosebud for my brother. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; Nevil laughed uneasily. Wanaha had a
way of putting things very directly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care
either way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet you pow-wow with him? You say &#8217;yes&#8217;
when he talks of Rosebud?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>It was the man&#8217;s turn to look away, and by doing
so he hid a deep cunning in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s because Little Black Fox is not an
easy man. He is unreasonable. It is no use arguing
with him. Besides, they will see he never gets
Rosebud.&#8221; He nodded in the direction of White
River Farm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have said he is very fierce. He has many
braves. One never knows. My brother longs for
the war-path. He would kill Seth. For Seth killed
our father. One never knows. It is better you say
to him, &#8216;Rosebud is white. The braves want no
white squaw.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>But the man had had enough of the discussion,
and began to whistle. It was hard to understand
how he had captured the loyal heart of this dusky
princess. He was neither good-looking nor of a
taking manner. His appearance was dirty, unkempt.
His fair hair, very thin and getting gray
at the crown, was long and uncombed, and his
moustache was ragged and grossly stained. Yet
she loved him with a devotion which had made her
willing to renounce her people for him if necessary,
and this means far more in a savage than it does
amongst the white races.</p>
<p>Steyne put on his greasy slouch hat and swung
out of the house. Wanaha knew that what she had
said was right, Nevil Steyne encouraged Little Black
Fox. She wondered, and was apprehensive. Nevertheless,
she went on with her work. The royal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
blood of her race was strong in her. She had much
of the stoicism which is, perhaps, the most pronounced
feature of her people. It was no good saying
more than she had said. If she saw necessity
she would do, and not talk.</p>
<p>She was still in the midst of her work when a
sound caught her ear which surely no one else could
have heard. In response she went to the door. A
rider, still half a mile away, was approaching. She
went back to her washing-up, smiling. She had
recognized the rider even at that distance. Therefore
she was in nowise surprised when, a few minutes
later, she heard a bright, girlish voice hailing her
from without.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wana, Wana!&#8221; The tone was delightfully imperious.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you have some place to tie a
horse to?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Rosebud. Wanaha had expected her, for
it was the anniversary of her coming to White River
Farm, and the day Ma Sampson had allotted for her
birthday.</p>
<p>Wanaha went out to meet her friend. This greeting
had been made a hundred times, on the occasion
of every visit Rosebud made to the woman&#8217;s humble
home. It was a little joke between them, for there
was a large iron hook high up on the wall, just out
of the girl&#8217;s reach, set there for the purpose of tying
up a horse. The squaw took the girl&#8217;s reins from
her hands, and hitched them to the hook.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome,&#8221; she said in her deep voice, and held
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
out a hand to be shaken as white folk shake hands,
not in the way Indians do it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it I must say to you?&#8221; she went on, in
a puzzled way. &#8220;Oh, I know. &#8217;Much happy return.&#8217;
That is how you tell me the last time you
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>The squaw&#8217;s great black eyes wore their wonderful
soft look as they gazed down upon her visitor.
It was a strange contrast they made as they stood
there in the full light of the summer afternoon sun.</p>
<p>Both were extremely handsome of figure, though
the Indian woman was more natural and several
inches taller. But their faces were opposite in every
detail. The squaw was dark, with clear velvety
skin, and eyes black and large and deeply luminous;
she had a broad, intelligent forehead over
which her straight black hair fell from a natural
centre parting, and was caught back from her face
at about the level of her mouth with two bows of
deep red braid. Her features might have been
chiseled by a sculptor, they were so perfectly symmetrical,
so accurately proportioned. And there
were times, too, when, even to the eyes of a white
man, her color rather enhanced her beauty; and
this was when her slow smile crept over her face.</p>
<p>Rosebud had no classical regularity of feature, but
she had what is better. Her face was a series of
expressions, changing with almost every moment as
her swift-passing moods urged her. One feature
she possessed that utterly eclipsed anything the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
stately beauty of the other could claim. She had
large, lustrous violet eyes that seemed like wells of
ever-changing color. They never looked at you
with the same shade in their depths twice. They
were eyes that madden by reason of their inconsistency.
They dwarfed in beauty every other feature
in the girl&#8217;s face. She was pretty in an irregular
manner, but one never noticed anything in her face
when her eyes were visible. These, and her masses
of golden hair, which flowed loosely about her head
in thick, rope-like curls, were her great claims to
beauty.</p>
<p>Now, as she stood smiling up into the dark face
above her, she looked what she was; a girl in the
flush of early womanhood, a prairie girl, wild as the
flowers which grow hidden in the lank grass of the
plains, as wayward as the breezes which sweep them
from every point of the compass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mayn&#8217;t I come in?&#8221; asked Rosebud, as the
woman made no move to let her pass.</p>
<p>Wanaha turned with some haste. &#8220;Surely,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I was thinking. What you call &#8216;dreaming.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>She eagerly put a stool for the girl to sit upon.
But Rosebud preferred the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Wana,&#8221; said the girl, playfully, &#8220;you said
you wanted me particularly to-day, so, at great inconvenience
to myself, and mother, I have come.
If it isn&#8217;t important you&#8217;ll get into grave trouble. I
was going to help Seth hoe the potatoes, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Seth.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
Wanaha had caught something of the other&#8217;s infectious
mood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he needs any pity, either,&#8221; said
Rosebud, impulsively. &#8220;Seth&#8217;s sometimes too much
of a good thing. He said I ought to learn to hoe.
And I don&#8217;t think hoeing&#8217;s very nice for one thing;
besides, he always gets angry if I cut out any of the
plants. He can just do it himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth&#8217;s a good man. He killed my father; but
he is good, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; For the moment Rosebud had become
grave. &#8220;I wonder what would have&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She
broke off and looked searchingly into her friend&#8217;s
face. &#8220;Wana,&#8221; she went on abruptly, &#8220;why did
you send for me to-day? I can&#8217;t stay. I really
can&#8217;t, I must go back and help Seth, or he&#8217;ll be so
angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud quite ignored her own contradictions, but
Wanaha didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, and it is not good to make Seth angry. He&mdash;what-you-call&mdash;he
very good by you. See, I say
come to me. You come, and I have&mdash;ah&mdash;ah,&#8221; she
broke off in a bewildered search for a word. &#8220;No&mdash;that
not it. So, I know. Birthday pre&mdash;sent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wanaha gave a triumphant glance into Rosebud&#8217;s
laughing face and went to a cupboard, also made of
packing cases, and brought forth a pair of moose-hide
moccasins, perfectly beaded and trimmed with black
fox fur. She had made them with her own hands
for her little friend, a labor of love into which she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
had put the most exquisite work of which she was
capable.</p>
<p>Rosebud&#8217;s delight was unfeigned. The shoes were
perfect. The leather was like the finest kid. It was
a present worthy of the giver. She held out her
hands for them, but the Indian laughed and shook
her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said playfully. &#8220;No, you white
woman! Your folk not carry things so,&#8221; and she
held the tiny shoes out at arm&#8217;s length. &#8220;You put
paper round, so.&#8221; She picked up one of her husband&#8217;s
newspapers and wrapped the present into a
clumsy parcel. &#8220;There,&#8221; she exclaimed, handing it
to the girl, &#8220;I wish you much happy!&#8221;</p>
<p>As she put the parcel into the outstretched hands,
Rosebud sprang from the table and flung her arms
round the giver&#8217;s neck, and kissed her heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the dandiest thing in the world, Wana,&#8221;
she cried impulsively, &#8220;and I love you.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A NEWSPAPER</h3>
</div>

<p>Seth was bending over his work among the potatoes.
It was a large order, for there were more
than five acres of it. Every time he stood erect to
ease his back he scanned the distance in the direction
of the White River. Each time he bent again
over his hoe, it was with a dissatisfied look on his
sunburnt face. He made up his mind that Rosebud
was playing truant again. He cared nothing for the
fact of the truancy, but the direction in which his
eyes turned whenever he looked up displayed his
real source of dissatisfaction. Rosebud had been
out since the midday dinner, and he guessed where
she was. The mosquitoes worried him to-day, which
meant that his temper was ruffled.</p>
<p>Suddenly he paused. But this time he didn&#8217;t look
round. He heard the sound of galloping hoofs racing
across the prairie. Continuing his work, he
roughly estimated the distance the rider was away.</p>
<p>He gave no sign at all until Rosebud&#8217;s voice called
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth, I&#8217;ve come to help you hoe,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The man saw that the horse was standing pawing
the ground among the potatoes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I take it friendly of you,&#8221; he said, eyeing the
havoc the animal was creating. &#8220;Guess that horse
o&#8217; yours has intentions that aways too. They&#8217;re
laud&#8217;ble, but misplaced.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl checked the creature, and turned him off
the patch. Then she quietly slid to the ground and
removed her saddle and bridle, and drove him off
out on the prairie for a roll.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry, Seth! I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;s made a mess
of these plants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud stooped and tried to repair the damage
her horse had done. She did not look in Seth&#8217;s direction,
but her smiling face conveyed nothing of her
regret. Presently she stood up and stepped gingerly
along the furrows toward the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you bring a hoe out for me?&#8221; she asked
innocently.</p>
<p>But her companion was used to the wiles of this
tyrant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess not,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t reckon
you&#8217;d get back that soon. Say, Rosebud, you&#8217;d
best git out o&#8217; those fixin&#8217;s if you&#8217;re going to git
busy with a hoe. Ma has her notions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-es. Do you think I&#8217;m getting any better
with a hoe?&#8221;</p>
<p>The eyes that looked up into Seth&#8217;s face were
candidly inquiring. There was not a shadow of a
smile on the man&#8217;s face when he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a notion you have few equals with a hoe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s always the way of folks wi&#8217; real talent.
Guess you&#8217;re an eddication with a hoe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth went on with his work until Rosebud spoke
again. She was looking away out across the prairie,
and her eyes were just a trifle troubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;d best get my things changed and&mdash;bring
out a hoe. How many rows do you think I could do
before tea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That mostly depends on how many p&#8217;tater plants
git in your way, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s face suddenly wreathed itself in
smiles.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, you&#8217;re laughing at me, and&mdash;well, I was
going to help you, but now I shan&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve been
down to see my Wanaha. Seth, you ought to have
married her. She&#8217;s the sweetest creature&mdash;except
Ma&mdash;I know. I think it&#8217;s a pity she married Nevil
Steyne. He&#8217;s a queer fellow. I never know what
to make of him. He&#8217;s kind to her, and he&#8217;s kind to
me&mdash;which I&#8217;m not sure I like&mdash;but I somehow
don&#8217;t like his eyes. They&#8217;re blue, and I don&#8217;t like
blue eyes. And I don&#8217;t believe he ever washes.
Do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth replied without pausing in his work. He
even seemed to put more force into it, for the hoe
cut into the earth with a vicious ring. But he
avoided her direct challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I haven&#8217;t a heap of regard for no Injuns
nor squaws. I&#8217;ve no call to. But I allow Wanaha&#8217;s
a good woman.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>Just for a moment the girl&#8217;s face became very
serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you say that, Seth. I knew you
wouldn&#8217;t say anything else; you&#8217;re too generous.
Wanaha is good. Do you know she goes to the
Mission because she loves it? She helps us teach
the little papooses because she believes in the &#8216;God
of the white folks,&#8217; she says. I know you don&#8217;t like
me to see so much of her, but somehow I can&#8217;t help
it. Seth, do you believe in foreboding?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say I&#8217;d gamble a heap that aways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know, but I believe it&#8217;s a good
thing that Wanaha loves me&mdash;loves us all. She has
such an influence over people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth looked up at last. The serious tone of the
girl was unusual. But as he said nothing, and
simply went on with his work, Rosebud continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I can&#8217;t understand you, Seth. I
know, generally speaking, you have no cause to
like Indians, while perhaps I have. You see, I have
always known them. But you seem to have taken
exception only to Little Black Fox and Wanaha as
far as I am concerned. You let me teach the Mission
children, you even teach them yourself, yet,
while admitting Wanaha&#8217;s goodness, you get angry
with me for seeing her. As for Little Black Fox, he
is the chief. He&#8217;s a great warrior, and acknowledged
by even the agent and missionary to be the
best chief the Rosebuds have ever had. Quite different
from his father.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Guess that&#8217;s so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why&mdash;may I not talk to them? And, oh,
Seth&#8221;&mdash;the girl&#8217;s eyes danced with mischief&mdash;&#8220;he is
such a romantic fellow. You should hear him talk
in English. He talks&mdash;well, he has much more
poetry in him than you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is mostly a form of craziness,&#8221; observed
Seth, quite unruffled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I like craziness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth&#8217;s occasional lapses into monosyllables annoyed
Rosebud. She never understood them. Now
there came a gleam of anger into her eyes, and
their color seemed to have changed to a hard
gray.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, whether you like it or not, you needn&#8217;t be
so ill-tempered about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth looked up in real astonishment at this unwarrantable
charge, and his dark eyes twinkled as
he beheld Rosebud&#8217;s own evident anger.</p>
<p>He shook his head regretfully, and cut out a bunch
of weeds with his hoe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;m pretty mean,&#8221; he said, implying that
her assertion was correct.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Rosebud&#8217;s anger was like all her moods,
swift rising and as swift to pass. Now it was approaching
its zenith. &#8220;And to show you how good
Wanaha is, look at this.&#8221; She unfolded her parcel
and threw the paper down, disclosing the perfect
moccasins the Indian had made for her. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
they lovely? She didn&#8217;t forget it was my birthday,
like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, so it is.&#8221; Seth spoke as though he had just
realized the fact of her birthday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t they lovely?&#8221; reiterated the girl. Her
anger had passed. She was all smiles again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indian,&#8221; said Seth, with a curious click of the
tongue, which Rosebud was quick to interpret into
an expression of scorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she exclaimed, firing up again, and her
eyes sparkling. &#8220;And I like Indian things, and I like
Indian people, and I like Little Black Fox. He&#8217;s
nice, and isn&#8217;t always sneering. And I shall see
them all when I like. And&mdash;and you can do the
hoeing yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>She walked off toward the house without the least
regard for the potatoes, which now suffered indiscriminately.
Her golden head was held very high,
but she had less dignity than she thought, for she
stumbled in the furrows as she went.</p>
<p>She went straight into the house and up to her
room; but she could not fling herself upon her bed
and cry, as she probably intended to do. Three
large parcels occupied its entire narrow limits.
Each was addressed to her, wishing her all happiness
on her birthday, and the biggest of the three
was from Seth. So, failing room anywhere else, she
sat in her rocking-chair, and, instead of an angry
outburst, she shed a few quiet, happy tears.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Seth continued his work as though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
nothing had interrupted him. It was not until
supper-time, and he was making his way to the
house, that he happened to observe the newspaper
which Rosebud had left lying among the potatoes.
He stepped across the intervening furrows and
picked it up. Newspapers always interested him,
he saw so few.</p>
<p>This one, he saw at once, was an English paper.
And from London at that. He glanced at the date,
and saw that was nearly a month old, and, at the
same time, he saw that it was addressed to Nevil
Steyne, and beside the address was a note in blue
pencil, &#8220;Page 3.&#8221;</p>
<p>His curiosity was aroused, and he turned over to
the page indicated. There was a long paragraph
marked by four blue crosses. It was headed&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Estate of the Missing Colonel Raynor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth read the first few lines casually. Then, as
he went on, a curious look crept into his dark eyes,
his clean-shaven face took on an expression of
strained interest, and his lips closed until they were
lost in a straight line which drew down at the corners
of his mouth. He read on to the end, and then
quietly folded up the paper, and stuffed it into the
bosom of his shirt. Once he turned and looked
away in the direction in which Nevil Steyne&#8217;s hut
lay tucked away on the river bank. Then he shouldered
his hoe and strolled leisurely homeward.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>AN INDIAN POW-WOW</h3>
</div>

<p>Nevil Steyne was indifferent to such blessings
as a refreshing thunder-shower at sundown on a hot
summer&#8217;s day. It is doubtful if he would have admitted
the beneficence of Providence in thus alleviating
the parching heat of the day. He had no crops
to think of, which made all the difference. Now, as
he walked along through the brush on the north bank
of the White River, in the direction of the log bridge,
with the dripping trees splashing all round him, and
his boots clogging with the heavy, wet loam, he
openly cursed the half-hour&#8217;s drenching. His vindictiveness
was in no way half-measured. He cursed
those who were glad of it, and who, when in direst
necessity, occasionally remembered to offer up
prayers for it.</p>
<p>This man had no love for the woods; no love
even for the prairie, or his life on it. He lived a
grudging existence. From his manner nothing in
life seemed to give him real joy. But there is no
doubt but that he had purpose of a sort which had
much to do with his associations with his Indian
neighbors. With him purpose served for everything
else, and made existence tolerable.</p>
<p>There was purpose in his movements now. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
could just as easily have made his way to the bridge
through the open, but he chose the woods, and put
up with the wet while he railed at it. And there was
some haste in his slouching, loose-jointed gait which
gave to his journey a suggestion of furtiveness.</p>
<p>At the bridge he paused, gave a quick look round,
and then crossed it more rapidly still. For at this
point he was in full view of the prairie. Once on the
Indian Reservation, which began beyond the bridge,
he again took to the cover the park-like land afforded
him. Nor did he appear again in the open
until he had passed the Mission and the Agency.</p>
<p>Once clear of these, however, he gave no more
heed to secrecy, and walked boldly along open paths
in the full, bright evening light. He passed in and
out among the scattered tepees, speaking a word
here and there to the men as he passed, or nodding
a greeting. The latter being the more frequent of
the two, for the Indian is a silent man.</p>
<p>The life amidst which he was walking was too
familiar to cause such a man as he any unusual interest.
Perhaps it was because he felt he had a certain
underhand power with these people; like a person
who loses interest in the thing which he has mastered.
Certain it is that the busy homes he beheld
were all unnoticed. The smoke-begrimed tepees
with their great wooden trailers propped against
them; the strings of drying meats stretching along
under the boughs of adjacent trees. The bucks huddled,
in spite of the warmth of summer, in their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
parti-colored blankets, gazing indolently at their
squaws pounding the early berries into a sort of
muddy preserve, or dressing a skin for manufacture
into leggings, moccasins, or buckskin shirt. He
gave no heed to the swarms of papooses, like so
many flies buzzing round the tepees, whooping in
imitation of their father braves, or amusing themselves
with the pursuit of one of the many currish
camp dogs, which, from their earliest years, they love
to persecute to the limits of the poor beasts&#8217; endurance.
The totem poles with their hideous carved
heads had no meaning for him, just as the dried
scalps which hung from the tepee poles might have
been rabbit skins for all he thought of them.</p>
<p>Just now his purpose was to reach the house of
Little Black Fox, and this he came to at last. It was
a large building; next to the Mission and Agency it
was by far the largest house on the Reservation. It
was built of logs and thatch and plaster, and backed
into a thick clump of shady maple trees. The son was
more lavish than the father. Big Wolf had always
been content to live in a tepee. He was an older
type of chief. The son moved with the times and
was given to display.</p>
<p>Nevil raised the latch of the door and walked in,
and his manner was that of a privileged visitor. He
entered the spacious living-room without word for
those he beheld gathered there. He walked to a
certain vacant place, and sat down upon the mud
floor. It was at once plain that he had been expected.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
More, it was evident that he belonged by
right to that gathering.</p>
<p>Despite the display in the dimensions of Little
Black Fox&#8217;s house the interior revealed the old savage.
There was nothing civilized about the council-chamber.
There was the central fire of smouldering
logs, without which no Indian can exist in summer
or winter. The smoke passed out through a square
chimney in the middle of the roof.</p>
<p>In a large circle the chief&#8217;s councilors sat perched
upon their haunches and swathed in their blankets.
There was not a seat or table there. They sat in
their councils as their forefathers had done before
them, their leader in their midst with nothing but his
youth to distinguish him from those who were his
subjects.</p>
<p>The debate proceeded in its spasmodic fashion.
There was no haste, no heat like in the debates of
civilized folk. Each man was listened to in respectful
silence, which might have served as an example
to modern legislatures. Nevil spoke like the rest in
their low, musical tongue. Whenever he spoke it
was noticeable that the great, wild eyes of the chief
were turned upon him with interest. But even he
seemed a mere unit in the debate, no more and no
less, unless it were that Little Black Fox was more
influenced by what he said than by what was said by
the others.</p>
<p>At length, well on into the night, the meeting drew
to a close. The business in hand had been threshed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
out and a decision arrived at. The warriors and the
men of &#8220;medicine&#8221; filed slowly out. Even in this
there was a certain formality and precedence. Each
man addressed his chief, shook hands, and passed
through the door. And no two went out together.</p>
<p>When the last had gone Nevil and the chief remained
alone in the bare room. Little Black Fox
rose from his pile of skins and stood erect. He was
a mere youth, but of such shape and appearance that
one could easily understand the epithet &#8220;romantic&#8221;
Rosebud had applied to him. He stood at least four
inches over six feet, and dwarfed even Nevil&#8217;s height.
But it was in the perfect symmetry of his lithe, sinuous
body, and the keen, handsome, high-caste face
where his attractions lay.</p>
<p>His eyes were the eyes of the untamed savage, but
of a man capable of great thought as well as great
reckless courage. There was nothing sinister in
them, but they were glowing, live eyes which might
blaze or soften in two succeeding moments, which
exactly expresses the man&#8217;s character. He was
handsome as Indian men go. Not like the women.
They are often beautiful in a way that appeals to any
artistic eye, but the men are a type for study before
they can be appreciated.</p>
<p>This chief was in the first flush of manhood, and
had attained nothing of the seared, bloated appearance
which comes to the Indian later in life. His
face was almost as delicately chiseled as his sister&#8217;s,
but it was strong as well as high caste. The eagle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
beakishness of his nose matched the flashing black
eyes. His mouth was sensitive and clean-cut. His
forehead was high and broad, and his cheeks were
delicately round.</p>
<p>Nevil became a wretched, unkempt type of manhood
in comparison. In form, at least, this chief of
twenty-one years was a veritable king.</p>
<p>He smiled on his white councilor when the last of
his own people had departed. He thrust out a slim,
strong hand, and the two men shook hands heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is slow with many in council,&#8221; the chief said,
in his own smooth-flowing tongue. &#8220;You, white
man, and I can settle matters quickly. Quicker
than these wise men of my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a flash of impatience in his speaking
eyes. Nevil nodded approval.</p>
<p>&#8220;They think much before they speak,&#8221; he replied,
in the language in which he had been addressed.
He, too, smiled; and in their manner toward each
other it was plain the excellent understanding they
were on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit, my white brother, we have many things for
talk. Even we, like those others, must sit if we
would pow-wow well. It is good. Sit.&#8221; Little
Black Fox laughed shortly, conceiving himself
superior in thought to the older generation of wise
men. He was possessed of all the vanity of his
years.</p>
<p>They both returned to the ground, and the chief
kicked together the embers of the council-fire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, brother, of Wanaha,&#8221; this still unproved
warrior went on, in an even, indifferent voice; &#8220;she
who was the light of our father&#8217;s eyes; she who has
the wisdom of the rattlesnake, and the gentle heart
of the summer moon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is well.&#8221; Nevil was not expansive. He
knew the man had other things to talk of, and he
wanted him to talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah. And all the friends of my white brother?&#8221;</p>
<p>The face smiled, but the eyes were keenly alight.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are well. And Rosebud&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She grows fairer every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a truly Indian pause. The fire sputtered
and cast shadows upon the dark, bare walls.
The two men gazed thoughtfully into the little flame
which vauntingly struggled to rear itself in the dense
atmosphere. At last the Indian spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;That man who killed my father is a great brave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Nevil, with a reflective smile in his
pale eyes. &#8220;And Rosebud is a ripe woman. Beautiful
as the flower which is her name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hah!&#8221; Then the Indian said slowly with an
assumed indifference, &#8220;She will be his squaw. This
white brave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is how they say.&#8221; It might have puzzled
Nevil to apply names to those represented by
&#8220;they.&#8221; &#8220;He is a great brave, truly. He fought
for her. He killed your father. That is how these
things go. She is for him surely.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>A frown had settled on the fierce young chief&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father was old,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Nevil glanced at the speaker out of the corner of
his eyes, and then continued his watch on the flame
still struggling so ardently to devour the half-green
wood. He knew when to hold his tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the young man went on. &#8220;My father was
a wise chief, but he was old&mdash;too old. Why did he
keep the white girl alive?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He took her for you. You only had fifteen
summers. The white girl had eleven or thereabouts.
He was wise. It was good med&#8217;cine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the chief stirred himself. And Nevil, who
lost no movement on the other&#8217;s part, detected the
restless action of one who chafes under his thought.
Little Black Fox prefixed his next remark with
another short laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;My people love peace now. It is good. So good
that your people come and teach us. They show our
squaws how to make things like the white squaws
make. And the papooses forget our tongue, and
they make words out of strange drawings which the
white med&#8217;cine man makes on a board. Tchah!
We forget our fathers. We feed when your people
give us food, and our young men are made to
plough. We only hunt when we are told to hunt.
Our life is easy, but it is not a brave&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil nodded, and chose his reply carefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it is a life of ease. You choose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
your life. And naturally you choose a life where
you have all you want, and do not have to trouble.
After all, what is the old life? A life of much danger,
and little ease. You fight, you kill, or you are killed.
You risk much and gain little. But you are men,
brave men, great warriors, I grant you. And the
squaws like brave men&mdash;even white squaws. But I
say it is wise, though not brave, to live in the tepee.
It is so easy. Your braves have their squaws always
with them. They grow fat till their sides shake.
They no longer care to hunt. Why should they?
Many papooses come, and they grow up like their
fathers. There are no Sun-Dances to make braves,
because none want to be braves. There are no
Ghost-Dances, because the white men keep the Evil
Spirits away, and there is no need. So. The Indian
lies upon his blankets, and he lives with the squaw
always. They all become squaw-men. Never was
there such peace for the Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil had drawn his peaceful picture with care;
also the tail of his eye told him that his companion
was listening. And his movements, every now and
then, had in them something of the spasmodic movements
of a chained wild beast. This lithe youth had
certain resemblance to the puma. He seemed to
burn with a restless craving spirit. The puma never
ceases to seek his prey. This man would be the
same were he once to begin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You say well,&#8221; he observed moodily, &#8220;we
are all squaw-men. The white squaws love braves,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
you say. I know all squaws love braves. The
squaws of our people will soon spit in our faces.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no squaw to do that,&#8221; observed Nevil,
bending over and pushing the fire together.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are chief. You should have many.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then give the word to your people and you can
have them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not want them&mdash;yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil looked round. The chief turned to the fire
uncertainly. His fierce eyes were half veiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;This Rosebud, she was for me,&#8221; he went on.
&#8220;She is fair as the summer sky. Her eyes are like
the stars, and her laugh is like the ripple of the
waters when the sun and the wind make play with
them. She is so fair that no squaw can compare
with her. Even Wanaha is as night to day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot have her. She is for the man who
killed your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young chief leapt to his feet with a cry that
told of a spirit which could no longer be restrained.
And he towered threateningly over the undisturbed
wood-cutter.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I will!&#8221; he cried vehemently, while his eyes
flashed in the dying light of the fire. &#8220;You are my
white brother, and to you I can say what is in my
thoughts. This squaw, I love her. I burn for her!
She is with me night and day. I will have her, I
tell you! There shall be no peace till my father is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
avenged. Ha, ha!&#8221; And the ferocity of that laugh
brought a smile to the hidden lips of the listening
man.</p>
<p>He looked up now, and his words came thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a great chief, Little Black Fox,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But, see, there is no need to go on the war-path.
Sit, like those wise councilors of yours. It is good
to pow-wow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The headstrong youth sat down again, and the
pow-wow went forward. It was daylight again when
Nevil returned to Wanaha. For Indian pow-wows
are slow moving, ponderous things, and Little Black
Fox was no better than the rest of his race when
deliberations of grave import were on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>SETH WASHES A HANDKERCHIEF</h3>
</div>

<p>Seth was not in the habit of making very frequent
visits to Beacon Crossing. For one thing there was
always plenty to do at the farm. For another the
attractions of the fledgling city were peculiarly suited
to idle folk, or folk who had money to spend. And
this man was neither the one nor the other.</p>
<p>White River Farm was a prosperous farm, but it
was still in that condition when its possibilities were
not fully developed, and, like the thrifty, foresighted
farmers Rube and his adopted son were, they were
content to invest every available cent of profit in
improvements. Consequently, when the latter did
find his way to Roiheim&#8217;s hotel it was always with a
definite purpose; a purpose as necessary as any of
his duties in his day&#8217;s labor.</p>
<p>Riding into the township one evening he made
straight for the hotel, and, refusing the stablehand&#8217;s
offer of care for his horse, sat down quietly on the
verandah and lit his pipe. Beyond the loungers in
the saloon and old Louis Roiheim no one worth any
remark approached him. He sat watching the
passers-by, but went on smoking idly. There were
some children playing a sort of &#8220;King-of-the-Castle&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
game on a heap of ballast lying beside the track,
and these seemed to interest him most. The sheriff
stopped and spoke to him, but beyond a monosyllabic
reply and a nod Seth gave him no encouragement
to stop. An Indian on a big, raw-boned
broncho came leisurely down the road and passed
the hotel, leaving the township by the southern trail.</p>
<p>Seth waited until the sun had set. Then he
stepped off the verandah and tightened the cinches
of his saddle, and readjusted the neatly rolled blanket
tied at the cantle. The proprietor of the hotel was
lounging against one of the posts which supported
the verandah.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217;?&#8221; he asked indifferently. Seth was not a
profitable customer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. So long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth swung into the saddle and rode off. And he,
too, passed out of the town over the southern trail.</p>
<p>Later he overhauled the Indian. It was Jim Crow,
the chief of the Indian police.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do we sleep to-night?&#8221; he asked, after
greeting the man.</p>
<p>Jim Crow, like all his race who worked for the
government, never spoke his own language except
when necessary. But he still retained his inclination
to signs. Now he made a movement suggestive of
three rises of land, and finished up with the word
&#8220;Tepee.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I must get back the day after to-morrow,&#8221; Seth
said. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll hit back through the Reservations.
I want to see Parker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said the Indian, and relapsed into that
companionable silence which all prairie men, whether
Indian or white, so well understand.</p>
<p>That night the two men sheltered in the tepee belonging
to Jim Crow. It was well off the Reservation,
and was never pitched in the same place two
nights running. Jim Crow&#8217;s squaw looked after that.
She moved about, acting under her man&#8217;s orders,
while the scout went about his business.</p>
<p>After supper a long talk proceeded. Seth became
expansive, but it was the Indian who gave information.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, in answer to a question the white
man had put. &#8220;I find it after much time. Sa-sa-mai,
my squaw. She find it from old brave. See
you. Big Wolf and all the braves who come out
this way, you make much shoot. So. They all
kill. &#8217;Cep&#8217; this one ol&#8217; brave. He live quiet an&#8217; say
nothing. Why? I not say. Some one tell him say
nothing. See? This Big Wolf. Before you kill
him maybe. So he not say. Bimeby Sa-sa-mai,
she much &#8217;cute. She talk ol&#8217; brave. Him very ol&#8217;.
So she learn, an&#8217; I go. I show you. You give me
fi&#8217; dollar, then I, too, say nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221; Seth pulled out a five-dollar bill and
handed it to the scout, and went on smoking. Presently
he asked, &#8220;Have you been there?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Jim Crow smiled blandly. He had the
truly Indian ambiguity of expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any traces, I
guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See. I go dis place. Little Black Fox hear.
He hear all. So. There are devils on the Reservation.
Jim Crow much watched. So. They know.
These red devils.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth noted the man&#8217;s air of pride. He was keenly
alive to his own importance and exaggerated it,
which is the way of his class. Jim Crow was a
treacherous rascal, but it paid him to work for the
white folk. He would work for the other side just
as readily if it paid him better.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; observed Seth, seriously; but it was
his pipe that absorbed his attention. &#8220;Wal, to-morrow,
I guess,&#8221; he added after a while. And, knocking
his pipe out, he rolled over on his blanket and slept.</p>
<p>On the morrow the journey was continued, and at
sundown they neared the great valley of the Missouri.
Their route lay over a trail which headed
southeast, in the direction of Sioux City. The sun
had just dropped below the horizon when Jim Crow
suddenly drew rein. Whatever character he might
bear as a man he was a master scout. He had a
knowledge and instinct far greater than that of a
bloodhound on a hot scent. He glanced around
him, taking in the lay of the land at every point of
the compass. Then he finally pointed at a brush
growing a few hundred yards from the trail.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The bluff,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It may be what we look
for. Sa-sa-mai, she tell me. Ow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last was a grunt which expressed assurance.</p>
<p>The horses left the trail for the prairie. The eyes
of both men were turned upon the ground, which is
the habit of such men when out on the trail. It is
the soil over which the prairie man passes which is
the book. The general scene is only the illustration.</p>
<p>At the bluff the men dismounted. Seth now took
the lead. He did not plunge haphazard into his
search. He still studied the brush and the ground.
But it was the scout whose trained instincts were the
first to discover the signs they sought. And he
found it in the dead, broken twigs which marked the
course of a wagon.</p>
<p>The two followed the lead; followed it unerringly.
With every foot of the way the task became easier.
Once they had turned the cover the book had become
the simplest reading. In a few minutes they came
to a clearing well screened from the road. Now
they parted company. The scout went on toward
the water further on, but the white man turned to
the clearing. Herein was displayed the difference
in the men. Seth had come to the point where
imagination served him. The other was only a
craftsman.</p>
<p>The grass was tall in the clearing. There was a
low scrub too, but it was a scrub that might be
trodden under foot. In two minutes Seth was
stooping examining a tent-peg, discolored by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
weather, but intact, and still holding in the earth
where it had been driven. It was but four yards
from this to a place where two distinct piles of
human bones were lying hidden in the rank grass.</p>
<p>Seth was on his knees pulling the grass aside, but
he did not touch the bones. The skeletons were far
from complete. Fortunately the skulls were there,
and he saw that they were those of a man and a
woman. While he contemplated the ghastly remains
his thoughts conjured up many scenes. He
saw the bullet hole through the woman&#8217;s skull, and
the horrid rift in the man&#8217;s. The absence of many
of the bones of the extremities made him think of
the coyotes, those prairie scavengers who are never
far off when death stalks the plains.</p>
<p>After a few moments he was searching the long
grass in every direction. He looked for remnants
of clothing; for anything to give him a sign. In his
search he was joined by the scout who had returned
from the water, where he had discovered further
traces of an encampment.</p>
<p>At last the examination was completed. There
was nothing left to indicate the identity of the bones.</p>
<p>The two men now stood by the bones of the unfortunate
man and woman. Seth was staring out at
the surrounding brush.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess the Injuns cleaned things up pretty well,&#8221;
he said, while his eyes settled on one little bush apart
from the rest.</p>
<p>The scout shook his head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not Injuns&#8217; work,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; Seth queried casually.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Everything gone. So. That not like
Injun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth made no response, but walked over to the
bush he had been looking at. The scout saw him
thrust a hand in amongst the branches and withdraw
it holding something.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you find?&#8221; he asked, when Seth came
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a rag.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, a moment later, Seth asked suddenly: &#8220;How
far from here to&mdash;Jason&#8217;s old place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Six&mdash;eight&mdash;nine hour,&#8221; Jim Crow said, with his
broad smile that meant nothing.</p>
<p>Seth looked long and thoughtfully at the split skull
on the ground. Then his eyes sought the bullet hole
in the woman&#8217;s skull. But he said nothing.</p>
<p>A little later the two men went back to the horses
and mounted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll git on to see the Agent,&#8221; Seth observed,
while the horses moved away from the
bluff.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go by Reservation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Crow surveyed the prospect in silence. They
reached the trail, and their horses stood preparatory
to parting company.</p>
<p>&#8220;S&#8217;long,&#8221; said Seth.</p>
<p>The Indian turned and looked away to the north.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
It was the direction in which lay the great Reservations.
Then he turned back, and his black, slit-like
eyes shot a sidelong glance at his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go&mdash;alone?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>The other nodded indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I say sleep little and watch much&mdash;I, Jim
Crow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men parted. The scout moved off and
his hand went to the pocket of his trousers where his
fingers crumpled the crisp five-dollar bill he had received
for his services. Nothing else really mattered
to him. Seth rode away humming a tune without
melody.</p>
<p>All the way to the Agent&#8217;s house he carried out
the scout&#8217;s advice of watchfulness; but for a different
reason. Seth had no personal fear of these stormy
Indians. His watchfulness was the observation of a
man who learns from all he sees. He slept some
hours on the prairie while his horse rested, and arrived
at the Agency the next day at noon.</p>
<p>Jimmy Parker, as he was familiarly called, greeted
him cordially in his abrupt fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, howdy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Prowling, Seth?&#8221; His
words were accompanied by a quick look that asked
a dozen questions, all of which he knew would remain
unanswered. Seth and he were old friends and
understood one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Takin&#8217; a spell off,&#8221; replied the farmer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah. And putting it in on the Reservation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Agent smiled briefly. His face seemed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
have worn itself into a serious caste which required
effort to change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many huntin&#8217; &#8217;passes&#8217; these times?&#8221; Seth inquired
presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;None. Only Little Black Fox says he&#8217;s going
hunting soon.&#8221; The Agent&#8217;s eyes were fixed on the
other&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;See you&#8217;ve got Jim Crow workin&#8217; around&mdash;south.&#8221;
Seth waved an arm in the direction whence he had
come.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Again came the Agent&#8217;s swiftly passing
smile. &#8220;We&#8217;re a good distance from the southern
boundary. Jim Crow&#8217;s smart enough. How did
you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saw his tepee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah. You&#8217;ve been south?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. There&#8217;s a fine open country that aways.&#8221;</p>
<p>They passed into the Agency, and Parker&#8217;s sister
and housekeeper brought the visitor coffee. The
house was very plain, roomy, and comfortable. The
two men were sitting in the office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seen anything of Steyne around?&#8221; asked Seth,
after a noisy sip of his hot coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much. And he&#8217;s very shy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth nodded. He quite understood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess suthin&#8217;s movin&#8217;,&#8221; he said, while he poured
his coffee into his saucer and blew it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought so, too, and written to the colonel
at the fort. What makes you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say. Guess it&#8217;s jest a notion.&#8221; Seth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
paused. Then he went on before the other could put
in a word. &#8220;Won&#8217;t be just yet. Guess I&#8217;ll git on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men passed out of the house, and Seth
remounted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you might let me know if Black Fox gits
his &#8216;pass,&#8217;&#8221; he said, as he turned his horse away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parker watched the horseman till he disappeared
amongst the bushes. A moment later he was talking
to his sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish I&#8217;d telegraphed to the fort now,&#8221; he said
regretfully. &#8220;I can&#8217;t do it after writing, they&#8217;d think&mdash;I
believe Seth came especially to convey warning,
and to hear about Black Fox&#8217;s pass. It&#8217;s a remarkable
thing, but he seems to smell what these Indians
are doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said his sister. But she felt that when two
such capable men discussed the Indians there was
no need for her to worry, so she took out Seth&#8217;s cup
and retired to her kitchen.</p>
<p>In the meantime Seth had reached the river. Here
he again dismounted, but this time for no more significant
reason than to wash out the rag he had rescued
from the bush south of the Reservations. He
washed and rewashed the cotton, till it began to regain
something of its original color. Then he examined
it carefully round the hem.</p>
<p>It was a small, woman&#8217;s handkerchief, and, in one
corner, a name was neatly written in marking ink.
The name was &#8220;Raynor.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE ADVENTURES OF RED RIDING HOOD</h3>
</div>

<p>It is Sunday. The plaintive tinkle of the schoolroom
bell at the Mission has rung the Christianized
Indians to the short service which is held there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indian Mission.&#8221; The name conveys a sense of
peace. Yet the mission histories of the Indian Reservations
would make bloody reading. From the
first the Christian teacher has been the pitiable prey
of the warlike savage. He bears the brunt of every
rising. It is only in recent years that his work has attained
the smallest semblance of safety. The soldier
fights an open foe. The man in charge of an Indian
mission does not fight at all. He stands ever in the
slaughter-yard, living only at the pleasure of the
reigning chief. He is a brave man.</p>
<p>The service is over. It is perforce brief. The
grown men and women come out of the building.
The spacious interior is cleared of all but the children
and a few grown-up folk who remain to hold a sort
of Sunday-school.</p>
<p>There are Wanaha and Seth. Rosebud, too, helps,
and Charlie Rankin and his young wife, who have a
farm some two miles east of White River Farm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
Then there is the missionary, Mr. Hargreaves, a
large man with gray hair and rugged, bearded face,
whose blue eyes look straight at those he is addressing
with a mild, invincible bravery. And the Agent,
James Parker, a short, abrupt man, with a bulldog
chest and neck, and a sharp, alert manner.</p>
<p>These are the workers in this most important
branch of the civilizing process. They are striking
at the root of their object. The children can be
molded where the parents prove impossible. Once
these black-eyed little ones have mastered the
English language the rest is not so difficult. They
have to be weaned from their own tongue if their
Christian teachers would make headway. A small,
harmless bribery works wonders in this direction.
And all these children have learned to speak and
understand the English language.</p>
<p>Seth attempts no Bible instruction, and his is a
class much in favor. His pockets always contain
the most home-made taffy. He has a method purely
his own; and it is a secular method. Only to the
brightest and most advanced children is the honor
of promotion to his class awarded.</p>
<p>He is holding his class outside the building. His
children sit round him in a semicircle. He is sitting
on an upturned box with his back against the lateral
logs of the building. There is a pleasant shade here,
also the pungent odor from the bright green bluff
which faces him. The Indian children are very quiet,
but they are agog with interest. They have noted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
the bulging pockets of Seth&#8217;s Sunday jacket, and
are more than ready to give him their best attention
in consequence. Besides they like his teaching.</p>
<p>Seth&#8217;s method is quite simple. Last Sunday he
told them a little, old-fashioned children&#8217;s fairy story
with a moral. Now he takes each child in turn, and
questions him or her on the teaching he then conveyed.
But in this direction they are not very apt,
these little heathens.</p>
<p>The singing inside the Mission had died out, and
the last chords on the small organ had wheezed themselves
into silence. Seth, having finished his preliminaries,
began serious business.</p>
<p>He deposited a large packet of treacle taffy upon
the ground at his feet, cut the string of it with his
sheath-knife, opened it, and examined the contents
with a finely critical air. Having satisfied himself
he set it down again and smiled on his twelve pupils,
all ranging from ten to twelve years of age, sitting
round him. He produced a well-thumbed volume
from his pocket, and, opening it, laid it upon his
knee. It was there in case he should stumble, for
Seth was not a natural born teacher. He did it for
the sake of the little ones themselves.</p>
<p>Next he handed each child a piece of taffy, and
waited while it was adjusted in the cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;ve all located your dollops o&#8217; candy?&#8221;
he said, after a while. &#8220;I allow you ken get right at
it and fix it in. This camp ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to be struck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
till the sweet food&#8217;s done. Guess you&#8217;ll mostly need
physic &#8217;fore you&#8217;re through, sure. Howsum, your
mam&#8217;s &#8217;ll see to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last remarks were said more to himself than
to the children, who sat staring up into his dark,
earnest face with eyes as solemn as those of the
moose calf, and their little cheeks bulging dangerously.
Seth cleared his throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you ain&#8217;t heard tell o&#8217; that Injun gal that
used to go around in a red blanket same as any of
you might. I&#8217;m jest going to tell you about her.
Ah, more candy?&#8221; as a small hand was held out
appealingly toward him. &#8220;Guess we&#8217;ll have another
round before I get going right.&#8221; He doled out
more of the sticky stuff, and then propped his face
upon his hands and proceeded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, as I was goin&#8217; to say, that little squaw
lived away there by the hills in a snug tepee with
her gran&#8217;ma. They were jest two squaws by themselves,
an old one, and a young one. And they
hadn&#8217;t no brave to help &#8217;em, nor nothin&#8217;. The young
squaw was jest like any of you. Jest a neat, spry
little gal, pretty as a picture and real good.</p>
<p>&#8220;She kind o&#8217; looked after her gran&#8217;ma who was
sick. Sick as a mule with the botts. Did the chores
around that tepee, bucked a lot of cord-wood, fixed up
moccasins, an&#8217; did the cookin&#8217;, same as you gals &#8217;ll
mebbe do later on. She was a slick young squaw,
she was. Knew a caribou from a jack-rabbit, an&#8217;
could sit a bucking broncho to beat the band. Guess
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
it was doin&#8217; all these things so easy she kind o&#8217; got
feelin&#8217; independent&mdash;sort o&#8217; wanted to do everything
herself. And she just used to go right down to the
store for food an&#8217; things by herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I don&#8217;t know how it rightly come about,
but somewheres around that tepee a wolf got busy.
A timber wolf, most as big as&mdash;as&mdash;the Mission
house. An&#8217; he was savage. Gee, but he was real
savage! Guess he was one o&#8217; them fellers always
ready to scare squaws an&#8217; papooses an&#8217; things.
Ther&#8217;s lots o&#8217; that sort around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wanaha, quite unobserved by Seth, had come
round the corner of the building, and stood watching
the earnest face of the man who was so deliberately
propounding his somewhat garbled version of
Little Red Riding Hood. While she listened to his
words she smiled pensively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they git themselves up fancy an&#8217; come
sneakin&#8217; around, an&#8217; they&#8217;re jest that fierce there
ain&#8217;t no chance for you. Say, them things would
eat you right up, same as you&#8217;ve eaten that taffy.
Wal, this young squaw was goin&#8217; off on her broncho
when this timber wolf comes up smilin&#8217;, an&#8217; he says,
&#8217;Good-day.&#8217; An&#8217; he shakes hands with her same as
grown folks do. All them timber wolves are like
that, &#8217;cause they think you won&#8217;t see they&#8217;re going to
eat you then. You see he was hungry. He&#8217;d been
out on the war-path&mdash;which is real bad&mdash;an&#8217; he&#8217;d
been fightin&#8217;, and the folks had beaten him off, and
he couldn&#8217;t get food, &#8217;cause he&#8217;d left the Reservation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
where there&#8217;s always plenty to eat an&#8217; drink, and
there was none anywhere else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, he sizes up that squaw, and sees her blanket&#8217;s
good an&#8217; thick, and her moccasins is made of
moose hide, and her beads is pretty, and he thinks
she&#8217;ll make a good meal, but he thinks, thinks he,
he&#8217;ll eat the squaw&#8217;s sick gran&#8217;ma first. So he says
&#8217;Good-bye,&#8217; an&#8217; waits till she&#8217;s well away on the
trail, and then hurries back to the tepee an&#8217; eats up
the old squaw. Say wolves is ter&#8217;ble&mdash;&#8217;specially
timber wolves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, when that squaw gits home&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Seth
paused and doled out more taffy. The children
were wonderfully intent on the story, but the sweets
helped their attention. For there was much of what
he said that was hard on their understandings. The
drama of the story was plain enough, but the moral
appealed to them less.</p>
<p>&#8220;When that squaw gits home she lifts the flap of
the tepee, and she sees what she thinks is her
gran&#8217;ma lying covered up on the skins on the
ground. The fire is still burnin&#8217;, and everything is
jest as she left it. She feels good an&#8217; chirpy, and
sits right down by her gran&#8217;ma&#8217;s side. And then
she sees what she thinks looks kind o&#8217; queer. Says
she, &#8216;Gee, gran&#8217;ma, what a pesky long nose you&#8217;ve
got!&#8217; You see that wolf had come along an&#8217; eaten
her gran&#8217;ma, and fixed himself up in her clothes an&#8217;
things, and was lying right there ready to eat her,
too, when she come along. So master timber wolf,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
he says, &#8216;That&#8217;s so I ken smell out things when I&#8217;m
hunting.&#8217; Then that squaw, bein&#8217; curious-like, which
is the way with wimminfolk, says, &#8216;Shucks, gran&#8217;ma,
but your tongue&#8217;s that long you ain&#8217;t room for it in
your mouth.&#8217; That wolf gits riled then. Says he,
&#8216;That&#8217;s so I ken taste the good things I eat.&#8217; Guess
the squaw was plumb scared at that. She&#8217;d never
heard her gran&#8217;ma say things like that. But she goes
on, says she, &#8216;Your teeth&#8217;s fine an&#8217; long an&#8217; white,
maybe you&#8217;ve cleaned &#8217;em some.&#8217; Then says the
wolf, &#8216;That&#8217;s so I ken eat folks like you right up.&#8217;
With that he springs out of the blankets an&#8217; pounces
sheer on that poor little squaw and swallows her up
at one gulp, same as you ken swaller this taffy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth suddenly sprang from his seat, held the bag
of candy out at arm&#8217;s length, and finally dropped it
on the ground in the midst of the children. There
was a rush; a chorus of childish glee, and the whole
twelve fell into a struggling heap upon the ground,
wildly fighting for the feast.</p>
<p>With a gentle smile Seth looked on at the fierce
scramble. To judge from his manner it would have
been hard to assert which was the happier, the children
or their teacher. Though Seth found them a
tax on his imaginative powers, and though he was a
man unused to many words, he loved these Sunday
afternoons with his young charges.</p>
<p>His thoughtful contemplation was broken by
Wanaha. Her moccasins gave out no sound as she
stepped up to him from behind and touched him on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
the shoulder. Her grave smile had passed; and
when he turned he found himself looking into a pair
of steady, serious, inscrutable eyes. No white woman
can hide her thoughts behind such an impenetrable
mask as the squaw. Surely the Indian face might
well have served as a model for the Sphinx.</p>
<p>&#8220;The white teacher makes much happy,&#8221; she said
in her labored English.</p>
<p>Seth promptly answered her in her own tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;The papooses of the Indian make the white man
happy,&#8221; he said simply.</p>
<p>There was a long pause. Suddenly one dusky
urchin rose with a whoop of delight, bearing aloft
the torn paper with several lumps of sweet stuff, discolored
with dirt, sticking to it. With one accord
the little mob broke. The triumphant child fled
away to the bluff pursued by the rest of her howling
companions. The man and the squaw were left
alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;The white man tells a story of a wolf and a
squaw,&#8221; Wanaha said, returning to her own language.
The children were still shrieking in the
distance.</p>
<p>Seth nodded assent. He had nothing to add to
her statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the wolf eats the squaw,&#8221; the woman went
on, quite seriously. It sounded strange, her literal
manner of discussing this children&#8217;s story.</p>
<p>A look of interest came into the man&#8217;s thoughtful
eyes. But he turned away, not wishing to display
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
any curiosity. He understood the Indian nature as
few men do.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no one by to warn the squaw?&#8221; she
went on in a tone of simple inquiry. &#8220;No brave to
help her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one to help,&#8221; answered the man.</p>
<p>There was another pause. The children still inside
the Mission house were helping to chant the
Doxology, and the woman appeared to listen to it
with interest. When it was finished she went on&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where the wolf is there is much danger for the
squaw. Indian squaw&mdash;or white. I, too, learn these
things. I learn from much that I hear&mdash;and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Seth nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wanaha is glad. The white brave will watch
over the young squaw.&#8221; The woman smiled again.
Seth thought he detected a sigh of relief. He understood
this woman as well as it is given to man to
understand any woman&mdash;even an Indian woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;This wolf won&#8217;t bother about the gran&#8217;ma,&#8221; said
Seth, looking straight into Wanaha&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;He&#8217;s
after the young squaw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he will have the young squaw soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wanaha abruptly turned away and hurried round
to the entrance of the Mission. The sound of people
moving within the building told her that the Sunday-school
was over. Her silent going suggested that
she had no wish to be seen talking in private to Seth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>Seth remained where he was. His delay may
have been intentional, yet he had the appearance of
deep preoccupation. He quite understood that
Wanaha&#8217;s presence during his story had been
deliberate. She had left her own class on some
trifling excuse and come out to warn him, knowing
that he would be alone with his children. There
was no smile on his face while he stood thinking,
only a pucker between his dark brows, and an odd
biting of his under-lip.</p>
<p>At last he shook himself as though he found the
shade chilly, and, a moment later, sauntered round
to the front of the building in time to meet the others
coming out.</p>
<p>He joined the group which included Wanaha, and
they talked a few minutes with the Agent and Mr. Hargreaves.
Then Mrs. Rankin and Rosebud moved
off to the two waiting buckboards, and Wanaha disappeared
down a by-path through the trees. Seth
and Charlie Rankin followed their womenfolk.</p>
<p>Seth was the only silent member of the party, but
this was hardly noticeable, for he rarely had much
to say for himself.</p>
<p>On the way home Rosebud at last found reason to
grumble at his silence. She had chattered away the
whole time in her light-hearted, inconsequent fashion,
and at last asked him a question to which she required
more than a nod of the head in reply. And
she had to ask it three times, a matter which ruffled
her patience.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you so grumpy with me, Seth?&#8221; she
asked, with a little frown. She always accused Seth
of being &#8220;grumpy&#8221; when he was more than usually
silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; The man turned from the contemplation
of the horses&#8217; tails.</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked you three times if you saw the Agent
talking to two of his scouts&mdash;Jim Crow and Rainmaker&mdash;before
service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth flicked his whip over the backs of the horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Crow is the head of his Indian police.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl spoke significantly, and Seth glanced
round at her in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think there is anything&mdash;moving? Oh,
look, Seth, there&#8217;s a lovely jack-rabbit.&#8221; Rosebud
pointed ahead. A large jack-rabbit was loping
slowly out of the way of the buckboard. Seth leant
forward with unnecessary interest, and so was saved
a direct answer to the girl&#8217;s question.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>SETH ATTEMPTS TO WRITE A LETTER</h3>
</div>

<p>It is not usually a remarkable event in one&#8217;s life,
the writing of a letter. In these days of telephone,
however, it soon will be. In Seth&#8217;s case it nearly
was so, but for a different reason. Seth could write,
even as he could read. But he was not handy at
either. He abominated writing, and preferred to
read only that which Nature held out for his perusal.
However, after some days of deep consideration, he
had decided to write a letter. And, with characteristic
thoroughness, he intended it to be very
long, and very explicit.</p>
<p>After supper one evening, when Rube had gone
out for his evening smoke, and that final prowl
round necessary to see that all was prepared for the
morrow&#8217;s work, and the stock comfortable for the
night, and Ma Sampson and Rosebud were busy
washing up, and, in their department, also seeing
things straight for the night, Seth betook himself to
the parlor, that haven of modest comfort and horsehair,
patchwork rugs and many ornaments, earthen
floor and low ceiling, and prepared for his task.
He had no desire to advertise the fact of that letter,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
so he selected this particular moment when the
others were occupied elsewhere.</p>
<p>His ink and paper were on the table before him,
and his pen was poised while he considered. Then
the slow, heavy footfall of old Rube sounded approaching
through the kitchen. The scribe waited
to hear him pass up-stairs, or settle himself in an
armchair in the kitchen. But the heavy tread came
on, and presently the old man&#8217;s vast bulk blocked
the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Writin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>The deep tone was little better than a grunt.</p>
<p>Seth nodded, and gazed out of the window. The
parlor window looked out in the direction of the
Reservation. If he intended to convey a hint it was
not taken. Old Rube had expected Seth to join
him outside for their usual smoke. That after-supper
prowl had been their habit for years. He
wanted to talk to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was yarnin&#8217; with Jimmy Parker s&#8217;afternoon,&#8221;
said Rube.</p>
<p>Seth looked round.</p>
<p>The old man edged heavily round the table till he
came to the high-backed, rigid armchair that had always
been his seat in this room.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says the crops there are good,&#8221; he went on,
indicating the Reservation with a nod of his head toward
the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be a good year all round, I guess,&#8221; Seth
admitted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I dare say it will be,&#8221; was the answer.</p>
<p>Rube was intently packing his pipe, and the other
waited. Rube&#8217;s deep-set eyes had lost their customary
twinkle. The deliberation with which he was
packing his pipe had in it a suggestion of abstraction.
Filling a pipe is a process that wonderfully
indicates the state of a man&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy&#8217;s worried some. &#8216;Bout the harvest, I
guess,&#8221; Rube said presently, adjusting his pipe in
the corner of his mouth, and testing the draw of it.
But his eyes were not raised to his companion&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Injuns ain&#8217;t workin&#8217; well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a queer lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-es. I was kind o&#8217; figgerin&#8217;. We&#8217;re mostly
through hayin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got another slough to cut.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. Down at the Red Willow bluff.&#8221;
The old man nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Seth. Then, &#8220;Wal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After that, guess ther&#8217;s mostly slack time till harvest.
I thought, mebbe, we could jest haul that
lumber from Beacon Crossing. And cut the logs.
Parker give me the &#8217;permit.&#8217; Seems to me we might
do wuss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the stockade?&#8221; suggested Seth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of that, too.&#8221; The two men looked
into each other&#8217;s eyes. And the old man nodded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Guess the gals wouldn&#8217;t want to know,&#8221; he said,
rising and preparing to depart.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I don&#8217;t think they would.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hardy old pioneer towered mightily as he
moved toward the door. In spite of his years he
displayed none of the uneasiness which his words
might have suggested. Nothing that frontier life
could show him would be new. At least, nothing
that he could imagine. But then his imagination
was limited. Facts were facts with him; he could
not gild them. Seth was practical, too; but he also
had imagination, which made him the cleverer man
of the two in the frontiersman&#8217;s craft.</p>
<p>At the door Rube looked round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you was goin&#8217; to write some?&#8221;</p>
<p>He passed out with a deep gurgle, as though the fact
of Seth&#8217;s writing was something to afford amusement.</p>
<p>Seth turned to the paper and dipped his pen in the
ink. Then he wiped it clean on his coat sleeve and
dipped it again. After that he headed his paper
with much precision. Then he paused, for he heard
a light footstep cross the passage between the parlor
and the kitchen. He sighed in relief as it started up-stairs.
But his relief was short-lived. He knew that
it was Rosebud. He heard her stop. Then he heard
her descend again. The next moment she appeared
in the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, Seth writing?&#8221; she exclaimed, her laughing
eyes trying to look seriously surprised. &#8220;I knew
you were here by the smell of the smoke.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Guess it was Rube&#8217;s.&#8221; Seth&#8217;s face relaxed for a
moment, then it returned to its usual gravity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it must have been that pipe you gave him
the other night,&#8221; she returned quick as thought.</p>
<p>Seth shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here it is,&#8221; he said, and drew a pipe from his
pocket. &#8220;He &#8217;lowed he hadn&#8217;t no nigger blood in
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too strong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal&mdash;he said he had scruples.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud laughed, and came and perched herself
on the edge of Seth&#8217;s table. He leant back in his
chair and smiled up at her. Resignation was his
only refuge. Besides&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re writing, Seth,&#8221; the girl said, and her
eyes had become really serious. They were deep,
deep now, the violet of them was almost black in the
evening light. &#8220;I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody yet,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean I&#8217;m to go away?&#8221; Rosebud smiled,
but made no attempt to move.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I ain&#8217;t in no hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad of that. And you&#8217;re not grumpy
with me either, are you? No?&#8221; as Seth shook his
head. &#8220;That&#8217;s all right, then, because I want to talk
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how I figgered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re always figuring, Seth. You figure so
much in your own quiet way that I sometimes fancy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
you haven&#8217;t time to look at things which don&#8217;t need
calculating upon. I suppose living near Indians all
your life makes you look very much ahead. I wonder&mdash;what
you see there. You and Rube.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re side-tracked,&#8221; Seth replied uneasily,
and turning his attention to the blank paper
before him.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s face took on a little smile. Her eyes
shone again as she contemplated the dark head of
the man who was now unconscious of her gaze.
There was a tender look in them. The old madcap
in her was taming. A something looked out of her
eyes now which certainly would not have been there
had the man chanced to look up. But he didn&#8217;t.
The whiteness of the paper seemed to absorb all his
keenest interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather think you always fancy I&#8217;m side-tracked,
Seth,&#8221; the girl said at last. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think I have
a serious thought in my foolish head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth looked up now and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;ve always been a child to me,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;An&#8217; kiddies ain&#8217;t bustin&#8217; with brain&mdash;generly.
However, I don&#8217;t reckon you&#8217;re foolish. &#8217;Cep&#8217; when
you git around that Reservation,&#8221; he added thoughtfully.</p>
<p>There was a brief silence. The man avoided the
violet eyes. He seemed afraid to look at them.
Rosebud&#8217;s presence somehow made things hard for
him. Seth was a man whom long years of a life
fraught with danger had taught that careful thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
must be backed up by steady determination. There
must be no wavering in any purpose. And this girl&#8217;s
presence made him rebel against that purpose he had
in his mind now.</p>
<p>&#8220;That has always been a trouble between us, hasn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; Rosebud said at last. And her quiet manner
drew her companion&#8217;s quick attention. &#8220;But it shan&#8217;t
be any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man looked up now; this many-sided girl
could still astonish him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quittin&#8217; the Reservation?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;except the sewing and Sunday classes at
the Mission,&#8221; Rosebud replied slowly. &#8220;But it&#8217;s not
on your account I&#8217;m doing it,&#8221; she added hastily,
with a gleam of the old mischief in her eyes. &#8220;It&#8217;s
because&mdash;Seth, why do the Indians hate you? Why
does Little Black Fox hate you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s inquiring eyes searched the bright
earnest face looking down upon him. His only reply
was a shake of the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;It&#8217;s on my account.
You killed Little Black Fox&#8217;s father to
save me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not <i>to</i> save you,&#8221; Seth said. He was a stickler
for facts. &#8220;<i>And</i> saved you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, bother! Seth, you are stupid! It&#8217;s on that
account he hates you. And, Seth, if I promise not
to go to the Reservation without some one, will you
promise me not to go there without me? You see
it&#8217;s safer if there are two.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>Seth smiled at the naïve simplicity of the suggestion.
He did not detect the guile at first. But it
dawned on him presently and he smiled more. She
had said she was not going to visit the Reservation
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who put these crazy notions into your head,
Rosebud?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s answer came very short. She didn&#8217;t
like being laughed at. And she thought he was
laughing at her now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one&#8217;s said something,&#8221; Seth persisted.
&#8220;You see Little Black Fox has hated me for six
years. There is no more danger for me now than
there was when I shot Big Wolf. With you it&#8217;s
kind o&#8217; different. You see&mdash;you&#8217;re grown&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221; Rosebud&#8217;s resentment had passed. She
understood her companion&#8217;s meaning. She had understood
that she was &#8220;grown&#8221; before. Presently
she went on. &#8220;I&#8217;ve learned a lot in the last few
days,&#8221; she said quietly, gazing a little wistfully out
of the window. &#8220;But nobody has actually told me
anything. You see,&#8221; with a shadowy smile, &#8220;I notice
things near at hand. I don&#8217;t calculate ahead.
I often talk to Little Black Fox. He is easy to read.
Much easier than you are, Seth,&#8221; she finished up,
with a wise little nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;ve figgered out my danger?&#8221; Seth surveyed
the trim figure reposing with such unconscious
grace upon the table. He could have feasted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
his eyes upon it, but returned to a contemplation of
his note-paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Will you promise me, Seth&mdash;dear old
Seth?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man shook his head. The wheedling tone
was hard to resist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You see, Rosebud,
ther&#8217;s many things take me there which must be
done. Guess I git around after you at times. That
could be altered, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re kind, Seth!&#8221; The girl
pouted her disappointment, but there was some other
feeling underlying her manner. The man looked up
with infinite kindness in his eyes, but he gave no
sign of any other feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Rosebud,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if ther&#8217;s a creetur in
this world I&#8217;ve a notion to be kind to, I guess she
ain&#8217;t more&#8217;n a mile from me now. But, as I said,
ther&#8217;s things that take me to the Reservation. Rube
ken tell you. So&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The man broke off, and dipped his pen in the ink.
Rosebud watched him, and, for once in her wilful
life, forgot that she had been refused something, and
consequently to be angry. She looked at the head
bending over the paper as the man inscribed, &#8220;Dear
sirs,&#8221; and that something which had peeped out of
her eyes earlier in their interview was again to be
seen there.</p>
<p>She reached out a hand as she slid from the table
and smoothed the head of dark hair with it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Seth,&#8221; she said gently. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have
no promises, but take care of yourself, because you
are my own old&mdash;&#8216;Daddy.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>At the door she turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can write your letter now,&#8221; she said, with a
light laugh. The next moment she was gone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE LETTER WRITTEN</h3>
</div>

<p>But Seth&#8217;s trials were not yet over. The two interviews
just passed had given Ma Sampson sufficient
time to complete her household duties. And
now she entered her parlor, the pride of her home.</p>
<p>She came in quite unaware of Seth&#8217;s presence
there. But when she observed him at the table with
his writing materials spread out before him, she
paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were
writin&#8217;, Seth!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s patience seemed inexhaustible, for he
smiled and shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Ma,&#8221; he said with truth.</p>
<p>The little old woman came round the table and
occupied her husband&#8217;s chair. If Seth were not
writing, then she might as well avail herself of the
opportunity which she had long wanted. She had
no children of her own, and lavished all her motherly
instincts upon this man. She was fond of Rosebud,
but the girl occupied quite a secondary place in her
heart. It is doubtful if any mother could have loved
a son more than she loved Seth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>She had a basket of sewing with her which she
set upon the table. Then she took from it a bundle
of socks and stockings and began to overhaul them
with a view to darning. Seth watched the slight
figure bending over its work, and the bright eyes
peering through the black-rimmed glasses which
hooked over her ears. His look was one of deep affection.
Surely Nature had made a mistake in not
making them mother and son. Still, she had done
the next best thing in invoking Fate&#8217;s aid in bringing
them together. Mrs. Sampson looked no older
than the day on which Rosebud had been brought
to the house. As Seth had once told her, she would
never grow old. She would just go on as she was,
and, when the time came, she would pass away
peacefully and quietly, not a day older than she had
been when he first knew her.</p>
<p>But Seth, understanding so much as he did of the
life on that prairie farm, and the overshadowing
threat which was always with them, had yet lost
sight of the significance of the extreme grayness of
this woman&#8217;s hair. Still her bright energy and uncomplaining
nature might well have lulled all fears,
and diverted attention from the one feature which
betrayed her ceaseless anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;I kind o&#8217; tho&#8217;t sech work was for young fingers,
Ma,&#8221; Seth observed, indicating the stockings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Seth, boy, I hated to darn when I was young
an&#8217; flighty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man smiled. His accusations had been made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
to ears that would not hear. He knew this woman&#8217;s
generous heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon Rosebud&#8217;ll take to it later on,&#8221; he said
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;When she&#8217;s married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-es.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth watched the needle pass through and through
the wool on its rippling way. And his thoughts
were of a speculative nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a grown woman now,&#8221; said Mrs. Sampson,
after a while.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; she&#8217;ll be thinkin&#8217; of &#8217;beaus,&#8217; or I&#8217;m no
prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Time enough, Ma.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Time? I guess she&#8217;s goin&#8217; on eighteen. Maybe
you don&#8217;t know a deal o&#8217; gals, boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bright face looked up. One swift glance at
her companion and she was bending over her work
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had &#8217;beaus&#8217; enough, I reckon, when I was
eighteen. Makes me laff when I think o&#8217; Rube.
He&#8217;s always been like what he is now. Jest quiet
an&#8217; slow. I came nigh marryin&#8217; a feller who&#8217;s got a
swell horse ranch way up in Canada, through Rube
bein&#8217; slow. Guess Rube was the man for me,
though, all through. But, you see, I couldn&#8217;t
ask him to marry me. Mussy on us, he was
slow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you have to help him out, Ma?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Help him? Did you ever know a gal who
didn&#8217;t help her &#8217;beau&#8217; out? Boy, when a gal gets
fixed on a man he&#8217;s got a job if he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to
get clear. Unless he&#8217;s like my Rube&mdash;ter&#8217;ble
slow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how you&#8217;re sizin&#8217; me now,&#8221; said Seth,
with a short laugh.</p>
<p>Ma Sampson worked on assiduously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re slow in some things, Seth,&#8221; she
ventured, after a moment&#8217;s thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Ma, I&#8217;ve always reckoned we&#8217;d get
yarnin&#8217; like this some day. It &#8217;ud please you an&#8217;
Rube for me to marry Rosebud. Wal, you an&#8217; me&#8217;s
mostly given to talkin&#8217; plain. An&#8217; I tell you right
here that Rosebud ain&#8217;t for the likes o&#8217; me. Don&#8217;t
you think I&#8217;m makin&#8217; out myself a poor sort o&#8217; cuss.
&#8217;Tain&#8217;t that. You know, an&#8217; I know, Rosebud belongs
to mighty good folk. Wal, before ther&#8217;s any
thought of me an&#8217; Rosebud, we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to locate
those friends. It&#8217;s only honest, Ma, and as such I
know you&#8217;ll understand. Guess we don&#8217;t need to
say any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sampson had ceased working, and sat peering
at her boy through her large spectacles. Seth&#8217;s
look was very determined, and she understood him
well.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re reckoning out your side.&#8221; She
laughed slyly and went on darning. &#8220;Maybe Rosebud
won&#8217;t thank you a heap when you find those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
friends. They haven&#8217;t made much fuss to find
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Ma. An&#8217; that&#8217;s just it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; The darning suddenly dropped into
Mrs. Sampson&#8217;s lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they were killed by the Injuns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re guessin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I am. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know, boy?&#8221; The old woman
was all agog with excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a great deal, Ma,&#8221; Seth said, with one of his
shadowy smiles. &#8220;But what I do makes me want
to write a letter. And a long one. An&#8217; that sort of
thing ain&#8217;t easy with me. You see, I&#8217;m &#8216;ter&#8217;ble
slow.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth&#8217;s manner was very gentle, but very decided,
and Ma Sampson did not need much explanation.
She quietly stood up and gathered her belongings
together.</p>
<p>&#8220;You get right to it, boy. What you do is right
for me. I&#8217;ll say no more. As my Rube says, ther&#8217;
ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; like livin&#8217; honest. An&#8217; so I says. But
if that letter&#8217;s goin&#8217; to lose you Rosebud, I&#8217;d take it
friendly of Providence if it would kind o&#8217; interfere
some. I&#8217;ll go an&#8217; sit with Rube, an&#8217; you can write
your letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last Seth turned to his letter in earnest.
He first pulled out a piece of newspaper from
his pocket and unfolded it. Then he laid it on
the table, and carefully read the long paragraph
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
marked by four blue crosses. He wanted to make
no mistake. As he had said himself, letter-writing
wasn&#8217;t easy to him. He read thoughtfully and
slowly.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>The Estate of the Lost Colonel Raynor</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Once more we are reminded of the mysterious
disappearance of that distinguished cavalry officer,
Colonel Landor Raynor. This reminder comes in
the form of the legal proceedings relating to his
estate.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the benefit of our readers, and also in the
gallant officer&#8217;s own interests, we give here a recapitulation
of the events surrounding his sudden
disappearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;On May 18th, 18&mdash;, Colonel Raynor returned
from service in Egypt, on six months&#8217; leave, and
rented a shooting-box in the Highlands. Hardly
had he settled down when he suddenly declared his
intention of crossing the Atlantic for a big game
shoot in the Rockies. This purpose he carried out
within four days of his announcement, accompanied
by Mrs. Raynor and their little daughter Marjorie,
aged eleven, a golden-haired little beauty with the
most perfect violet eyes, which is a very rare and
distinguishing feature amongst women. It has been
clearly proved that the party arrived safely in New
York, and proceeded on their way to the Rockies.
Since that time nothing has been heard of any of the
three.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There is no definite pronouncement as to the administration
of Colonel Raynor&#8217;s estate. He owns
large property, valued roughly at nearly a quarter
of a million sterling. It has come to light that he
leaves a will behind him, but whether this will be
executed or not remains to be seen. There are no
near relations, except the colonel&#8217;s brother, Stephen,
who was disinherited by their father in favor of the
colonel, and who, it is believed, left this country
at the time, and went to the United States. His
whereabouts are also unknown, in spite of advertisement
during the last six years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We publish these details, even at this late hour,
in the faint hope that some light may yet be thrown
on the mystery which enshrouds the fate of the gallant
colonel and his family, or, at least, that they
may assist in discovering the whereabouts of his
brother. Theories have been put forward. But the
suggestion which seems most feasible comes from
the New York police. They think he must have met
with some accident in the obscurer mountains, for he
was a daring climber, and that, unaccompanied as
they were by any servants, his wife and daughter,
left helpless, were unable to get back to civilization.
There is a chance that misfortune of some other
character overtook him, but of what nature it is impossible
to estimate. It has been asserted by one of
the officials at the railway station at Omaha that a
party alighted from a transcontinental train there
answering the description of Colonel Raynor&#8217;s party.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
These people are supposed to have stayed the night
at a hotel, and then left by a train going north. Inquiry,
however, has thrown no further light in this
direction, and so the police have fallen back on their
original theory.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>Seth laid the cutting aside, and thoughtfully
chewed the end of his pen. There were many
things he had to think of, but, curiously enough,
the letter he had to compose did not present the
chief item. Nor did Rosebud even. He thought
chiefly of that railway official, and the story which
the police had so easily set aside. He thought of
that, and he thought of the Indians, who now more
than ever seemed to form part of his life.</p>
<p>Finally he took a fresh piece of paper and headed
it differently. He had changed his mind. He originally
intended to write to the New York police. Now
he addressed himself to the Editor of the &mdash;&mdash;, London,
England. And his letter was just the sort of
letter one might have expected from such a man,
direct, plain, but eminently exact.</p>
<p>As he finally sealed it in its envelope there was no
satisfaction in the expression of his face. He drew
out his pipe and filled it and lit it, and smoked with
his teeth clenching hard on the mouthpiece. He sat
and smoked on long after Rube had looked in and
bade him good-night, and Ma had come in for a
good-night kiss, and Rosebud had called out her
nightly farewell. It was not until the lamp burnt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
low and began to smell that he stole silently up to
his bed. But, whatever thought had kept him up to
this hour, he slept soundly, for he was a healthy-minded
man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>CROSS PURPOSES</h3>
</div>

<p>Seth was out haying. It was noon, and his dinner
hour. He and his old collie dog, General, were
taking their leisure on the slope of Red Willow
slough, while the horses, relieved of their bits and
traces, were nibbling at the succulent roots of the
grass over which the mower had already passed.</p>
<p>General possessed a sense of duty. His master
was apparently sleeping, with his prairie hat drawn
over his face. The dog crouched at his feet, struggling
hard to keep his eyes open, and remain alert
while the other rested from his labors. But the sun
was hot, the scent of the grass overpowering, and it
was difficult.</p>
<p>At last the man roused and sat up. The dog
sprang to his feet. His ears were pricked, and he
raced off across the slough. As he went, the sound
of wheels became distinctly audible. Rosebud,
seated in a buckboard, and driving the old farm mare,
Hesper, appeared on the opposite side of the slough.
She was bringing Seth his dinner.</p>
<p>A moment later the girl drew rein and sprang out
of the vehicle. The heat in no way weighed upon
her spirits. She looked as fresh and cool in her
white linen dress and sun-hat as if it were an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
early spring day. Her laughing face was in marked
contrast to the man&#8217;s dark, serious countenance.
Her dazzling eyes seemed to be endowed with something
of the brilliancy of the sunlight that was so
intensely pouring down upon them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Seth, I&#8217;m so sorry!&#8221; she cried, in anything
but a penitent tone, &#8220;but just as I was starting Wana
came up with a note for you, and I&#8217;m afraid we
stopped and talked, and you know what a dozy old
mare Hesper is, and she just went slower than ever,
and I hadn&#8217;t the heart to whack her, she&#8217;s such a
dear, tame old thing, and so I&#8217;m ever so late, and
I&#8217;m afraid your dinner&#8217;s all spoiled, and you&#8217;ll be
horribly angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Seth displayed no anger; he only held out
his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; the note?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud thought for a moment. &#8220;Whatever did
I do with it?&#8221; she said, looking about her on the
ground. Seth watched her a little anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was it from?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just the old Agent. I don&#8217;t suppose it was
important, but I know I put it somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth lifted the dinner-box out of the buckboard.
Suddenly Rosebud&#8217;s face cleared.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, Seth. I put it in there. In with the
dinner. Oh, and, Seth, I got Ma to let me bring
my dinner out, so we can have a picnic, you and I,
and General.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>Seth was bending over the box.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I guess your dinner&#8217;s kind o&#8217; spoiled too,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that doesn&#8217;t matter so long as yours isn&#8217;t.
You see it&#8217;s my own fault, and serves me right. If
it&#8217;s very nasty we can give it all to General; so it
won&#8217;t be wasted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it won&#8217;t be wasted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud watched her companion remove the
things from the box, and wondered if he were glad
or sorry that she was going to have her dinner with
him. She had been wildly delighted at the thought
of springing this surprise on him, but now she felt
doubtful, and a certain shyness kept her usually
busy tongue silent. She would have given much to
know what Seth thought. That was just where
she found the man so unsatisfactory. She never
did know what he really thought about anything.</p>
<p>Seth found the note, and put it in his pocket.
Now he set their meal on the newly cut grass.
Rosebud, with a thoughtfulness hardly to be expected
of her, turned Hesper loose. Then she
sat down beside General and put the tin dishes
straight, according to her fancy. In silence she
helped Seth to a liberal portion of lukewarm stew,
and cut the bread. Then she helped the dog, and,
finally, herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;s a dear!&#8221; she suddenly exclaimed, when
the silence had become irksome to her. &#8220;She&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
making me a new dress. It&#8217;s a secret, and I&#8217;m not
supposed to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! An&#8217; how d&#8217; you find out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I asked Pa,&#8221; Rosebud laughed. &#8220;I knew
it was something for me. So when he went to look
at the new litter of piggies this morning I went with
him, and just asked him. I promised not to give
him away. Isn&#8217;t she a dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Guess you like dress fixin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Love them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most gals do, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see, Seth, most girls love to look nice.
Mrs. Rankin, even, says that she&#8217;d give the world to
get hold of a good dressmaker, and she&#8217;s married.
Do you know even Wana likes pretty things, and
that&#8217;s just what I&#8217;d like to talk to you about. You
see, I&#8217;ve got twenty dollars saved, and I just thought
I would get Wana a nice dress, like white people
wear. I mean a good one. Do you know what
store I could send to in Sioux City, or Omaha, or
even New York?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t much knowledge o&#8217; stores an&#8217; things.
But I &#8217;lows it&#8217;s a good notion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s brown eyes looked over at the girl as
she plied her knife and fork.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; he went on, a moment later, &#8220;ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t
no need to spend them twenty dollars. I&#8217;ve got
some. Say, you talk to Ma an&#8217; fix the letter an&#8217; I&#8217;ll
mail it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked up. Seth&#8217;s kindness had banished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
the ready laugh for the moment. If her tongue remained
silent her eyes spoke. But Seth was concerned
with his food and saw nothing. Rosebud
did not even tender thanks. She felt that she could
not speak thanks at that moment. Her immediate
inclination was a childish one, but the grown woman
in her checked it. A year ago she would have acted
differently. At last Seth broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Rosebud,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How&#8217;d you like a
heap o&#8217; dollars?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the girl&#8217;s serious mood had not yet passed.
She held out her plate to General, and replied, without
looking at her companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You see, I wouldn&#8217;t
like to marry a man with lots of money. Girls who
do are never happy. Ma said so. The only other
way to have money is by being clever, and writing,
or painting, or play-acting. And I&#8217;m not clever, and
don&#8217;t want to be. Then there are girls who inherit
money, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s jest it,&#8221; broke in Seth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what?&#8221; Rosebud turned from the dog and
eyed her companion curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, s&#8217;pose it happened you inherited them
dollars?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not likely to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. But we know your folks must a&#8217; been
rich by your silk fixin&#8217;s. Guess you ain&#8217;t thought o&#8217;
your folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s sunburnt face took on a confident little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
smile as she looked out from under the wide brim of
her hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I have. I&#8217;ve thought a lot. Where are
they, and why don&#8217;t they come out and look for me?
I can&#8217;t remember them, though I try hard. Every
time I try I go back to Indians&mdash;always Indians. I
know I&#8217;m not an Indian,&#8221; she finished up naïvely.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Seth lit his pipe. &#8220;Guess if we did find
&#8217;em you&#8217;d have to quit the farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a short silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth, you&#8217;re always looking for them, I know.
Why do you look for them? I don&#8217;t want them.&#8221;
Rosebud was patting the broad back of General.
&#8220;Do you know, sometimes I think you want to be
rid of me. I&#8217;m a trouble to you, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t that exactly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth&#8217;s reply sounded different to what he intended.
It sounded to the girl as if he really was seeking her
parents to be rid of her. And his manner was so
deliberate, so short. She scrambled to her feet without
a word, and began to gather up the dishes. Seth
smoked on for a moment or two. But as Rosebud
showed no sign of continuing the conversation he,
too, rose in silence, and went over to Hesper and
hitched her to the buckboard. Then he came back
and carried the dinner-box to the vehicle, while Rosebud
mounted to the driving-seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth,&#8221; she said, and her face was slightly flushed,
and a little sparkle of resentment was in her eyes,
&#8220;when you find them I&#8217;ll go away. I never looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
at it as you do. Yes, I think I should like that heap
of dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth smiled slowly. But he didn&#8217;t quite understand
her answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, you see, Rosebud, I&#8217;m glad you take it that
aways. You see it&#8217;s better you should go. Yes,
much better.&#8221;</p>
<p>His thoughts had turned on the Reservations, that
one direction in which they ever seemed to turn.
Rosebud was thinking in another direction. Seth
wanted to be rid of her, and was meanly cloaking
his desire under the guise of her worldly welfare.
The angry flush deepened, and she sat very erect
with her head held high as she drove off. Nor did
she turn for her parting shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll find them; I want to go,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Seth made no answer. He watched her until the
vehicle dropped down behind the brow of the farther
slope. The girl&#8217;s attitude was as dignified as she
could make it while she remained in view. After
that it was different. And Seth failed to realize that
he had not made his meaning plain. He saw that
Rosebud was angry, but he did not pause to consider
the cause of her anger.</p>
<p>He stood where she had left him for some time.
He found his task harder than ever he had thought
it would be. But his duty lay straight before him,
and, with all his might, he would have hurried on his
letter to England if he could. He knew he could see
far ahead in the life of his little world as it affected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
himself and those he loved. He might be a dull-witted
lover, but he was keen and swift to scent
danger here on the plains; and that was what he had
already done. Cost him what it might, Rosebud
must be protected, and this protection meant her removal.</p>
<p>He sighed and turned back to his work, but before
he went on with it he opened and read the note which
Rosebud had thought so unimportant.</p>
<p>He read it twice over.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Little Black Fox applied for &#8217;pass&#8217; for hunting.
He will probably leave the Reservation in three
weeks&#8217; time. He will take a considerable number of
braves with him; I cannot refuse.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE DEVOTION OF WANAHA</h3>
</div>

<p>Nevil Steyne&#8217;s day&#8217;s labor, of whatever it consisted,
was over. Wanaha had just lit the oil lamp
which served her in her small home.</p>
<p>The man was stretched full length upon the bed,
idly contemplating the dusky beauty who acknowledged
his lordship, while she busied herself over her
shining stove. His face wore a half smile, but his
smile was in nowise connected with that which his
eyes rested on.</p>
<p>Yet the sight he beheld was one to inspire pleasurable
thoughts. For surely it falls to the lot of few
men, however worthy, to inspire one woman with
such a devotion as Wanaha yielded to him. Besides,
she was a wonderful picture of beauty, colored it is
true, but none the less fair for that. Her long black,
braided hair, her delicate, high-bred face so delightfully
gentle, and her great, soft black eyes which had
almost, but not quite, lost that last latent glimmer of
the old savage. Surely, she was worth the tenderest
thought.</p>
<p>But Nevil&#8217;s thoughts were not with her, and his
smile was inspired by his thoughts. The man&#8217;s
mean, narrow face had nothing pleasant in it as he
smiled. Some faces are like this. He was a degenerate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
of the worst type; for he was a man who had
slowly receded from a life of refinement, and mental
retrogression finds painful expression on such a face.
A ruffian from birth bears less outward trace, for his
type is natural to him.</p>
<p>Wanaha always humored her husband&#8217;s moods,
in which, perhaps, she made a grave error. She held
silent until he chose to speak. And when she turned
at last to arrange the supper table, he was so moved.
The smile had died out of his thin face, and his pale
blue eyes wore a look of anxious perplexity when he
summoned her attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wana,&#8221; he said, as though rousing himself from
a long worrying thought, &#8220;we must do something,
my Wana. And&mdash;I hardly know what.&#8221;</p>
<p>The black eyes looked straight into the blue ones,
and the latter shifted to the table on which the
woman&#8217;s loving hands had carefully set the necessaries
for supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; she said simply, &#8220;you who are clever&mdash;maybe
I help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it, my Wana. I believe you can.
You have a keen brain. You always help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil relapsed into silence, and bit nervously at
his thumb nail. The woman waited with the stoical
patience of her race. But she was all interest, for had
not the man appealed to her for help?</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your brother,&#8221; Nevil said at last. &#8220;Your
brother, and the white girl at the farm, Rosebud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>The dark eyes suddenly lit. Here was a matter
which lay very near her heart. She had thought so
much about it. She had even dared at other times to
speak to her husband on the subject, and advise him.
Now he came to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the man went on, still with that look of
perplexity in his shifty eyes; &#8220;perhaps I have been
wrong. You have told me that I was. But, you
see, I looked on your brother as a child almost.
And if I let him talk of Rosebud, it was, as I once
told you, because he is headstrong. But now he has
gone far enough&mdash;too far. It must be stopped.
The man is getting out of hand. He means to have
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wanaha&#8217;s eyes dilated. Here indeed was a terrible
prospect. She knew her brother as only a
woman can know a man. She had not noted the
melodramatic manner in which her husband had
broken off.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say well. It must be stop. Tell your
Wana your thought. We will pow-wow like great
chiefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s just it,&#8221; Nevil went on, rising and
drawing up to the table. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see my way
clearly. We can&#8217;t stop him in whatever he intends.
He&#8217;s got some wild scheme in his head, I know; and
I can&#8217;t persuade him. He&#8217;s obstinate as a mule.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so. Little Black Fox is fierce. He never
listen. No. But you think much. You, who are
clever more than all the wise men of my race.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>Wanaha served her husband with his food. Whatever
might be toward, her duty by him came first.
Nevil sat eating in what appeared to be a moody
silence. The velvety eyes watched his every expression,
and, in sympathy, the woman&#8217;s face became
troubled too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course we must warn&mdash;some one,&#8221; Nevil
went on at last. &#8220;But the question is, who? If I
go to the Agent, it&#8217;ll raise trouble. Parker is bullheaded,
and sure to upset Black Fox. Likely he&#8217;ll
stop his going hunting. If I warn old Rube Sampson
it&#8217;ll amount to the same thing. He&#8217;ll go to the
Agent. It must be either Seth or Rosebud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good, good,&#8221; assented the Indian woman eagerly.
&#8220;You say it to Seth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil ate silently for some minutes, while the
woman looked on from her seat beside the stove.
Whatever was troubling the man it did not interfere
with his appetite. He ate coarsely, but his Indian
wife only saw that he was healthily hungry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re right again, my Wana,&#8221; Nevil exclaimed,
with apparent appreciation. &#8220;I&#8217;d prefer to
tell Seth, but if I did he&#8217;d interfere in a manner that
would be sure to rouse your brother&#8217;s suspicions.
And you know what he is. He&#8217;d suspect me or you.
He&#8217;d throw caution to the devil, and then there&#8217;d be
trouble. It&#8217;s a delicate thing, but I can&#8217;t stand by
and see anything happen to your chum, my Wana.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I love the paleface girl,&#8221; replied Wanaha,
simply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It comes to this,&#8221; Nevil went on, with something
like eagerness in his manner. &#8220;We must warn her,
and trust to her sense. And mind, I think she&#8217;s
smart enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s dark eyes looked very directly
into the man&#8217;s. Nevil was smiling again. His
anxiety and perplexity seemed suddenly to have
vanished, now that he had come to his point; as
though the detailing of his fears to her had been the
real source of his trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I think it will be simple enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man left the table and came to the woman&#8217;s
side. He laid one hand caressingly on her black
hair, and she responded with a smiling upward glance
of devotion. &#8220;See, you must tell her I want to
speak with her. I can&#8217;t go to her. My presence at
the farm is not welcome for one thing,&#8221; he said bitterly,
&#8220;and, for another, in this matter I must not be
seen anywhere near her. I&#8217;ve considered this thing
well. She mustn&#8217;t come here either. No.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke reflectively, biting his long, fair moustache
in that nervous way he so often betrayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, my Wana, must see her openly at the farm.
You must tell her that I shall be in the river woods
just below the bridge, cutting wood at sundown on
Monday. That&#8217;s three days from now. She must
come to me without being seen, and without letting
any one know of her visit. The danger for me, for
us, my Wana, is great, and so you must be extra
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
careful for all our sakes&mdash;and so must she. Then I
will tell her all, and advise her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s eyes had never left his face. The
trust and confidence her look expressed were almost
touching. She did not question. She did not ask
why she could not give the girl her warning. Yes,
she understood. The proceeding appealed to her
nature, for there is no being in the world to compare
with the Indian when native cunning is required.
She could do this thing. Was it not for Rosebud?
But, above all, was it not for him? The honest man
rarely puts faith in a woman&#8217;s capacity outside her
domestic and social duties. The rascal is shrewder.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a good way,&#8221; she said, in her deep, soft
voice, after much thought. &#8220;And I go&mdash;yes. I tell
her. I say to her that she must not speak. And
she say &#8217;yes.&#8217; I know Rosebud. She clever too.
She no child.&#8221; She paused, and the man moved
away to his seat. She looked over at him and presently
went on. &#8220;Rosebud, she love Seth. I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil suddenly swung round. Only the blind eyes
of love could have failed to detect the absolute look
of triumph which had leapt to the man&#8217;s face. Wanaha
mistook the look for one of pleasure, and went
on accordingly, feeling that she had struck the right
note.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And Seth, he love too. They are to each
as the Sun and the Moon. But they not know this
thing. She think Seth think she like sister. Like
Black Fox and your Wana. But I know. I love
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
my man, so I see with live eyes. Yes, these love.
So.&#8221; And the dark eyes melted with a consuming
love for the man she was addressing.</p>
<p>Nevil sprang from his seat, and, crossing to the
dark princess, kissed her with unwonted ardor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good, my Wana; you are a gem. You see
where I am blind.&#8221; And for once he was perfectly
sincere.</p>
<p>&#8220;It good?&#8221; she questioned. Nevil nodded, and
at once the woman went on. &#8220;So. I know much.
Rosebud tell me much. She much angry with Seth.
She say Seth always&mdash;always look for find her white
folks. She not want them&mdash;these white folks. She
love Seth. For her he is the world. So. She say
Seth angry, and want her go away. Wana listen.
Wana laugh inside. Wana love too. Seth good.
He love her much&mdash;much. Then she say she think
Seth find these white folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth has found Rosebud&#8217;s&mdash;folk?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s brows had drawn together over his
shifty blue eyes, and a sinister look had replaced
the look of triumph that had been there before.</p>
<p>&#8220;She say she think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! She only thinks.&#8221; Nevil&#8217;s thumb was at
his mouth again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wanaha finished. The change in the man&#8217;s face
had checked her desire to pursue the subject. She
did not understand its meaning, except that her talk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
seemed no longer to please him; so she ceased.
But Nevil was more interested than she thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what made her think so?&#8221; he asked
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;She not say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s a pity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The room became silent. The yellow light of the
lamp threw vague shadows about, and these two
made a dark, suggestive picture. The woman&#8217;s
placid and now inscrutable face was in marked contrast
to her husband&#8217;s. His displayed the swift
vengeful thoughts passing behind it. His overshot
jaws were clenched as closely as was physically possible,
while his pallid eyes were more alight than
Wanaha had ever seen them. As he sat there, biting
his thumb so viciously, she wondered what had
angered him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how he could have found them,&#8221; he
said at last, more to himself than to her. But she
answered him with a quiet reassurance, yet not understanding
why it was necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;She only think,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But he must have given her some cause to
think,&#8221; he said testily. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re not as
cute as I thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wanaha turned away. His words had caused her
pain, but he did not heed. Suddenly his face
cleared, and he laughed a little harshly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I doubt if he&#8217;ll lose her
through that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>The ambiguity of his remark was lost upon the
Indian. She heard the laugh and needed no more.
She rose and began to clear the table, while Nevil
stood in the open doorway and gazed out into the
night.</p>
<p>Standing there, his face hidden from Wanaha, he
took no trouble to disguise his thoughts. And from
his expression his thoughts were pleasant enough,
or at least satisfactory to him, which was all he could
reasonably expect.</p>
<p>His face was directed toward White River Farm,
and he was thinking chiefly of Seth, a man he hated
for no stronger reason than his own loss of caste, his
own degeneracy, while the other remained an honest
man. The deepest hatreds often are founded on
one&#8217;s own failings, one&#8217;s own obvious inferiority to
another. He was thinking of that love which
Wanaha had assured him Seth entertained for Rosebud,
and he was glad. So glad that he forgot many
things that he ought to have remembered. One
amongst them was the fact that, whatever he might
be, Wanaha was a good woman. And honesty
never yet blended satisfactorily with rascality.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE WARNING</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Ma,&#8221; exclaimed Rosebud, after a long and unusual
silence while she was washing up the breakfast
things, and Mrs. Sampson was busy with some cleaning
at the other side of the kitchen, &#8220;do you ever get
tired of your work here? Your life, I mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was early morning. Already the heat in the
kitchen was intense. Ma looked hot, but then she
was stooping and polishing, and the flies were
provoking. Rosebud, in linen overall, still looked
cool. Her face was serious enough, which seemed
to be the result of some long train of thought. Ma
suddenly stopped working to look up, and waved a
protesting hand at the swarming flies. She found
the girl&#8217;s violet eyes looking steadily into hers.
There was an earnestness in their depths as unusual
as the seriousness of her face. The old woman had
been about to answer hastily, but she changed her
mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I, child?&#8221; she said, as though such
a contingency were out of all reason. &#8220;It&#8217;s all ours,
I guess. It&#8217;s jest ours to make or mar. Ther&#8217; isn&#8217;t
a stick on this farm that we haven&#8217;t seen set ther&#8217;,
Rube an&#8217; me. Tired of it? Guess the only tire I&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
feel&#8217;ll come when I can&#8217;t set foot to the ground, an&#8217;
ain&#8217;t the strength to kindle a stove or scrub a floor.
Tired? No, child. What fixed you to get askin&#8217;
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>The plates clattered under Rosebud&#8217;s hands as she
went on with her work. Ma eyed the stack of dishes
in some doubt. She thought there might be some
excuse for the girl being a little tired of domestic
duties. She often wondered about this. Yet she
had never heard Rosebud complain; besides, she
had a wise thought in the back of her head about
the girl&#8217;s feelings toward at least one of their little
family circle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know, Ma,&#8221; the girl said at last.
Then she added quickly, feeling, of a sudden, that
her question had suggested something she did not
intend. &#8220;Don&#8217;t think I am. I was wondering over
something else.&#8221; She laughed a little uncertainly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s Seth. He&#8217;s always harping on my going away.
Always thinking of the time when my people are to
be found. And I just wondered if he thought I was
tired of the farm and wanted to be away. He&#8217;s so
kind and good to me, and I thought he might, in a
mistaken way, believe I&#8217;d be happier in&mdash;well, with
those people who have forgotten my very existence.
I love the farm, and&mdash;and all of you. And I don&#8217;t
want to go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma turned again to her work with a wise little
smile in her twinkling eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth&#8217;s a far-seein&#8217; boy, an&#8217; a good boy in &#8217;most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
everything,&#8221; she said, in a tone indicating wholehearted
affection; &#8220;but he&#8217;s like most folks with
head-pieces, I guess. He don&#8217;t stop at things which
it is given to men to understand. Ef I wus a man
I&#8217;d say of Seth, he&#8217;s li&#8217;ble to git boostin&#8217; his nose
into places not built fer a nose like his. Seein&#8217; I&#8217;m
his &#8217;Ma,&#8217; I&#8217;d jest say he ain&#8217;t no call to git figgerin&#8217;
out what&#8217;s good fer wimminfolk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I think,&#8221; exclaimed Rosebud,
with a quick laugh. &#8220;He made me quite angry
some time ago. He means to get me off the farm
somehow. And&mdash;and&mdash;I could just thump him for
it.&#8221; The girl&#8217;s seriousness had passed, and she
spoke lightly enough now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men-folk do rile you some,&#8221; nodded Ma. But
the twinkle had not left her eyes. &#8220;But, my girl, I
shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Seth&#8217;s got mighty good
reason. An&#8217; it ain&#8217;t to do with his personal feelin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud went on with her washing without speaking.
She was thinking of that picnic she had taken
with Seth and General nearly three weeks ago. It
had almost developed into a serious quarrel. It
would have done so, only Seth refused to quarrel.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said, one day, he thought it was better I
should go. Much better,&#8221; she said, presently.
&#8220;Well, it made me angry. I don&#8217;t want to go, and
I don&#8217;t see why Seth should be allowed to order
me to go. The farm doesn&#8217;t belong to him. Besides&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, y&#8217; see, Rosebud, you&#8217;re forgettin&#8217; Seth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
brought you here. He&#8217;s a kind of father to you.&#8221;
Ma smiled mischievously in the girl&#8217;s direction, but
Rosebud was too busy with her own thoughts to
heed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not my father, or anything of the kind.
He&#8217;s just Seth. He&#8217;s not thirty yet, and I am eighteen.
Pa&#8217;s a father to me, and you are my mother.
And Seth&mdash;Seth&#8217;s no relation at all. And I&#8217;m just
not going to call him &#8217;Daddy&#8217; ever again. It&#8217;s that
that makes him think he&#8217;s got the right to order me
about,&#8221; she added, as a hasty afterthought.</p>
<p>Further talk was interrupted at that moment by a
knock at the back door. Rosebud passed out into
the wash-house to answer the summons, and Ma
Sampson heard her greet the Indian woman,
Wanaha. The old farmwife muttered to herself
as she turned back to her work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess Seth ain&#8217;t got the speed of a jibbin&#8217; mule,&#8221;
she said slowly and emphatically.</p>
<p>The girl did not return, and Ma, looking out of
the window, saw the two women walking together,
engaged in earnest conversation. She looked from
them to the breakfast things, and finally left her
own work and finished the washing up herself. It
was part of her way to spare Rosebud as much as
she could, and the excuse served her now.</p>
<p>While Rosebud was receiving a visit from Wanaha
at the back of the house, the men-folk, engaged in
off-loading pine logs from a wagon, were receiving
visitors at the front of it. The Indian Agent and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
Mr. Hargreaves had driven up in a buckboard. The
Agent&#8217;s team was sweating profusely, a fact which
the sharp eyes of Seth were quick to detect; also he
noted that Parker was driving a team and not the
usual one horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind o&#8217; busy?&#8221; questioned Seth, in answer to
the two men&#8217;s greetings.</p>
<p>The Agent glanced at the steaming horses and
nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going into Beacon Crossing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Rube, in his heavy, guttural fashion.
&#8220;Gettin&#8217; fixin&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Agent smiled, and nodded at the minister
beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of a sort; we both are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Seth who spoke, and a shade more sharply
than usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I want to send a wire over the line, and
wait a reply. We shan&#8217;t be out again until Tuesday,
and that&#8217;s why we came over. There&#8217;ll be no sewing
class on Monday. You see, Mr. Hargreaves is
going with me. We are driving instead of riding,
because we&#8217;re going to bring out some small arm
ammunition. We&#8217;re both getting short of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Agent&#8217;s manner was casual enough, but the
minister&#8217;s face was grave. The former endeavored
to pass lightly over the matter of the ammunition.</p>
<p>A brief silence followed. It was broken at last
by the Agent again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Getting on with the logs?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. We&#8217;re fixin&#8217; a big corral right round the
farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Rube who explained; and the old man
glanced from Seth with a comprehensive survey of
the proposed enclosure.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; said Mr. Hargreaves, &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t
let Rosebud come to the Mission on Sunday. I
shan&#8217;t be there, but Jackson from Pine Ridge will
hold the service. You see, there&#8217;s&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The
churchman broke off, and turned appealingly to the
Agent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is,&#8221; Parker said, in his quick, abrupt
manner, &#8220;Jim Crow and some of the other boys
have warned me that these red heathens are &#8216;making
med&#8217;cine.&#8217; I don&#8217;t know what it means&mdash;yet. I
wish to goodness the troops were nearer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Agent&#8217;s hard face was very set. His final wish
was the key-note of his life. His was truly an unsmiling
existence.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re jest goin&#8217; in to sound the warnin&#8217;,&#8221;
observed Seth. The other nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to cancel Little Black Fox&#8217;s pass on
Monday,&#8221; Parker went on, &#8220;but it would be a bad
policy. Anyway, if he goes out for a month the
others will likely keep quiet until he comes back, unless
of course this pass of his has another meaning.
I shall have him tracked. But&mdash;well, we&#8217;d best get
on. I should give some slight word of this to the
Rankin people and old Joe Smith, north of you, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
any one else you have time to&mdash;I mean the men-folk.
You know, the usual thing, pass it on.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a few more remarks the buckboard drove
off and Rube and Seth returned to their work. The
silence between them was broken at last by Rube.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me ther&#8217;s something to that pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Seth, thoughtfully. Then, with an
impatient gesture, &#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll go into Beacon myself
to-day. There&#8217;s a thing or two for me to do. Keep
an eye on the wimminfolk. Guess I&#8217;ll git goin&#8217;
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth&#8217;s announcement was received without question
by Rube, for there was perfect understanding
between these men.</p>
<p>Half an hour later Seth was leading his horse
from the barn ready saddled for the journey. As he
moved out he saw Rosebud coming toward him
from the house. He waited, and she came up in
something of a flutter of confusion. She had an unusual
color, and her eyes were sparkling. Seth
noted these things while he appeared to be arranging
the contents of his saddle-bags.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pa says you&#8217;re going into Beacon Crossing,
Seth,&#8221; she said without preamble, as she stood at the
horse&#8217;s head and idly smoothed its velvety muzzle
with her soft brown hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; the man answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve written a letter to New York for a store
price list. Will you mail it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>There was an odd smile in Seth&#8217;s dark eyes. He
knew this was not the girl&#8217;s object in coming to him.
He always called in at the house to ask for letters at
the last moment before starting. There was a slight
awkwardness while he waited for the girl to go on.</p>
<p>Suddenly Rosebud stooped and ran her hands
down the horse&#8217;s fore-legs. Her face was thus concealed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth, I used to think you wanted to get rid of
me. You remember? Well, I&mdash;I think I know
differently now. I&#8217;m sure I do. And I want to say
I&#8217;m sorry for being angry and nasty about it that
time. What beautiful clean legs Buck has got.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-es.&#8221; A soft light shone in the man&#8217;s steady
eyes as he gazed upon the girl&#8217;s still bent figure.
One of his hands was resting on the cantle of his
saddle, and for a moment it gripped tight. He was
suddenly swept by a passionate longing that was
hard to resist, and his answer came in a slightly
husky tone. &#8220;You see, Rosie, when I want to be
quit of you, it ain&#8217;t for anything you do or say,
it&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash; Guess I must be goin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud had abruptly straightened up, and her
bright eyes were smiling into his face. At that
moment Seth could not support the flashing inquiry
of them, so he sought safety in flight. He vaulted
into the saddle almost as he spoke, and, with a wave
of his hand, rode off, leaving her undeniably mistress
of the situation.</p>
<p>She followed him with her eyes as he rode to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
kitchen door and hailed Ma. Her smile was still
wreathing her pretty features when he finally headed
away for the trail. It became more and more tender
as horse and rider receded, and at last she turned
away with a sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what he&#8217;d say if he knew what I&#8217;ve
promised Wana?&#8221; she said to herself. Then she
laughed a sudden, wilful laugh as she remembered
that she hadn&#8217;t given him her letter.</p>
<p>But Seth was not quite free to go his way.
Another interruption occurred about half a mile
from the farm, where the trail dipped so that he
was completely hidden from view. He overtook
Wanaha. The Indian had been walking steadily on,
but, since the sound of his horse&#8217;s hoofs reached her,
she had been waiting at the roadside.</p>
<p>He greeted her and would have passed on, but
she stopped him, addressing him in her soft, flowery,
native tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is of Rosebud,&#8221; she said, her dark eyes looking
solemnly up into his. &#8220;My brother, the great
chief, he love her, and in his love is danger for her.
I come. And I tell her these things. You love her.
So, it is good. You know Indian as no other knows,
&#8217;cep&#8217; my man. He learn this danger, and he send
me for warning. I tell her to-day. You I tell too,
for you have much knowledge and you watch. So.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What danger? What is it?&#8221; Seth&#8217;s questions
came very sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I not know. It is so. My man he not know.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
He say only &#8217;danger.&#8217; He say Black Fox leave
Reservation. So, watch. An&#8217; I tell you. You
must speak no word, or there danger for my man
too, and for Wanaha. It is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I understand. You&#8217;re a good squaw,
Wanaha.&#8221;</p>
<p>He passed on, for Wanaha waited for no questions.
She had done what she thought best. Had
not Nevil seen the gravity of the matter? But of
her own accord she had gone further than her instructions.
She had warned Seth, whom Nevil had
said must not be told. For once in her life Wanaha
had exercised her own judgment in defiance of her
husband&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The squaw passed down the deep prairie furrow
while Seth held to the trail. And the man&#8217;s thoughts
went back to the interview he had had with Rosebud
that morning. So it was Wanaha who had caused
her to come to him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE MOVEMENTS OF LITTLE BLACK FOX</h3>
</div>

<p>The woodlands on the northern side of the great
Reservations of Dakota amount almost to a forest.
From Beacon Crossing, after entering the Pine
Ridge Reservation, a man might travel the whole
length of the Indian territory without the slightest
chance of discovery, even by the Indians themselves;
that is, provided he be a good woodsman.
And this is what Seth accomplished. He did it
without any seeming care or unusual caution. But
then he was consummate in the necessary craft
which is to be found only amongst the sons of the
soil, and, even then, rarely outside the few who have
been associated with Indians all their lives.</p>
<p>It was soon after sunrise on Monday morning
that Seth found himself in the neighborhood of the
principal Indian camp of the Rosebuds. Yet none
had seen him come. He was hidden in the midst of
a wide, undergrown bluff. Directly in front of him,
but with at least four hundred yards of uninterrupted
view intervening, was the house of Little
Black Fox.</p>
<p>Seth was not usually a hard rider&mdash;he was far too
good a horseman&mdash;but when necessity demanded it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
he knew how to get the last ounce out of his horse.
He had left the farm on Saturday morning, and at
midnight had roused the postmaster of Beacon
Crossing from his bed. Then, at the hotel of Louis
Roiheim, he had obtained a fresh horse, and, by
daylight on Monday morning, after traveling the
distance through nothing but mazy woodland, had
reached the locality of Little Black Fox&#8217;s abode.
Thus he had covered something like one hundred
and seventy miles in less than forty-eight hours.
Nor had he finished his work yet.</p>
<p>Now he lay on the ground in the shadow of the
close, heavy-foliaged brush, watching with alert, untiring
eyes. Something of the Indian seemed to
have grown into the nature of this uncultured product
of the prairie world. He had smothered the
only chance of betrayal by blindfolding his horse,
now left in the well-trained charge of the dog,
General. For himself he gave no sign. Not a leaf
moved, nor a twig stirred where he lay. If he
shifted his position it must have been done in the
manner of the Indians themselves, for no sound resulted.
He knew that a hundred pairs of eyes would
infallibly detect his presence at the least clumsy disturbance
of the bush. For the Indian is like the bear
in his native woods. He may be intent in another
direction, but the disturbance of the leaves, however
slight, in an opposite direction, will at once attract
his attention.</p>
<p>The squaws were astir at daylight. Now, as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
sun rose, it became apparent that there were many
preparations going forward in the chief&#8217;s quarters.
There was a gathering of ponies in a corral hard by.
Also the long &#8220;trailers,&#8221; already packed with tepee-poles
and great bundles of skins and blankets, were
leaning against the walls of the corral.</p>
<p>To Seth&#8217;s practised eyes these things denoted an
early departure; and, by the number of ponies and
the extent of the equipment, it was evidently to be the
going of a large party. But time went on, and no
further move was made. Only all those who came
and went seemed busy; not on account of what they
did, but from their manner and movement. Through
the greater part of the day Seth kept his sleepless
watch. Only once did he abandon his post, and
then merely to return to his horse to secure food from
his saddle-bags. When he rose to go thither it was
to be seen that he was fully armed, which had not
been the case when he left the farm.</p>
<p>Seth&#8217;s arguments were as simple and straightforward
as he was himself, and none the less shrewd.
The position was this. The Indians were in a state
of ferment, to which, of course, the chief was party.
Second, the chief was going off on a hunting trip,
and apparently abandoning his people at a critical
time. Third, he had received warning of Rosebud&#8217;s
danger from one whose knowledge and good-will
could be relied on. Fourth, the warning had come
to them, indirectly, from the one man who he now
had every reason to suspect had no very good-will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
toward Rosebud; but he also saw, or thought he
saw, the reason of that warning. It was that this
man might clear himself should the chief&#8217;s plans go
wrong. These were Seth&#8217;s arguments, and he intended
to prove them by remaining on Little Black
Fox&#8217;s trail until he was assured that the danger to
Rosebud no longer existed. It was in the nature of
the man that he had sought no outside aid, except
that of his faithful General.</p>
<p>The story the watcher read as he observed the
Indians&#8217; movements was a long one. The climax of
it did not come until late in the afternoon, and the
conclusion not until an hour later.</p>
<p>The climax was reached when he saw a tall figure
coming up from the direction of the bridge. A grim
pursing of the lips lent a curious expression to the
smile that this appearance brought to his face. The
man was clad in a blanket, and his gait was the gait
of an Indian. There was nothing to give any other
impression to the casual observer. But Seth was very
intent, and he saw the color of the man&#8217;s face. It was
then that his lips shut tight and his smile developed
something tigerish in its appearance.</p>
<p>However, he remained quite still, and saw the man
pass into the chief&#8217;s house. He did not reappear
for a full half-hour. When at last he came out he
departed at once the way he had come. Half an
hour later the chief&#8217;s ponies, a number of squaws, and
the baggage, set out accompanied by half a dozen
mounted bucks. Another half-hour and Little Black
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
Fox appeared and vaulted to the back of his waiting
pony. A dozen warriors joined him almost at the
same moment, gathering from different directions,
and the chief rode off at their head.</p>
<p>Then it was that Seth rose from his hiding-place.
He stood watching the going of these men until he
had made sure of the direction they were taking.
They were making for the river ford, and he instantly
ran back to his horse and mounted. Just for a second
he hesitated. Then he set off for the wagon
bridge as fast as he could urge his horse.</p>
<p>It was late the same afternoon that Charlie Rankin
rode up to the River Farm and greeted Rube, who
was hard at work upon the stockade. He was a
large, cheery Britisher, with a florid face and ready
laugh. He drew up with a jerk, sprang to the
ground, and began talking with the perfect freedom
of long friendship.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve passed the word, Rube,&#8221; he said, without
any preamble. &#8220;It&#8217;s gone the round by this time.
I thought I&#8217;d run over and consult you about the
womenfolk. I&#8217;m new to this work. You are an old
bird. I thought of sending the missis into Beacon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rube paused in his work and surveyed the horizon,
while, in his slow way, he wiped the perspiration
from his weather-furrowed face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, Charlie,&#8221; he said, without displaying the
least concern. &#8220;Wal, I don&#8217;t know. Y&#8217; see this
thing&#8217;s li&#8217;ble to fizzle some. We&#8217;ve had &#8217;em before.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
Guess my missis an&#8217; the gal&#8217;ll stay right here by us.
I &#8217;low I feel they&#8217;re safer wi&#8217; us. Mebbe it&#8217;s jest a
notion. If things gits hummin&#8217; I&#8217;d say come right
along over an&#8217; share in wi&#8217; us. Y&#8217; see if it&#8217;s a case
of git, we&#8217;d likely do better in a party. Seth&#8217;s away
jest now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man&#8217;s quiet assurance was pleasant to the
less experienced farmer. There was soundness in
his plans too. Charlie nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good of you. Of course, we&#8217;ve got the
warning, but we don&#8217;t know how far things are moving.
Do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, no. But I don&#8217;t think ther&#8217;s anything to
worry over fer a week or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought there couldn&#8217;t be, because I saw your
Rosebud riding down toward the river as I came
along. And yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Rube broke in upon him vehemently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; to the river?&#8221; he cried. Then his usual
slow movements suddenly became electrical. He
strode away to the barn, and left Charlie to follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; the latter asked, as he paused in
the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up? Up? What&#8217;s up?&#8221; The old man was
saddling a big raw-boned mare with almost feverish
haste. &#8220;She&#8217;s no right goin&#8217; that aways. An&#8217; I
promised Seth, too. I didn&#8217;t know but what she wus
in the kitchen. Here, fix that bridle while I get into
the house. Ha&#8217; y&#8217; got your gun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but why?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wal&mdash;y&#8217; never can figger to these durned Injuns
when they&#8217;re raisin&#8217; trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man was off like a shot, while Charlie
fixed the great mare&#8217;s bridle. He returned almost
immediately armed with a brace of guns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, ken y&#8217; spare an hour or so?&#8221;</p>
<p>As Charlie looked into the old farmer&#8217;s face when
he made his reply he read the answer to all he would
have liked to ask him. Rube was consumed with
an anxiety that no words, delivered in his slow
fashion, could have conveyed to any one but Seth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, as long as you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good boy,&#8221; said Rube, with an air of relief. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t ask you, but it&#8217;s fer her.&#8221; And the two
men rode off hastily, with Rube leading.</p>
<p>&#8220;By-the-way,&#8221; said Charlie, drawing his horse up
alongside the dun-colored mare, &#8220;Joe Smith, north
of us, says some neighbor of his told him there were
tents on the plains further north. I was wondering.
The troops haven&#8217;t been sent for, have they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say,&#8221; said Rube, without much interest.
Then he asked hastily, &#8220;Which way was she
headin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question showed the trend of his whole
thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, straight down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Nevil Steyne&#8217;s shack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He lives that way, doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men rode on in silence. This was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
first time Charlie had ever seen Rube disturbed out
of his deliberate manner. He made a mental resolve
to bring his wife and children into White River Farm
at the first sign of actual danger.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>GENERAL DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF</h3>
</div>

<p>Never since her first coming to the farm had
Rosebud been forced to keep her goings and comings
secret. But Wanaha had made it imperative
now. It went sorely against the girl&#8217;s inclination,
for she hated deception of any kind; and she knew
that what she meditated was a deception against
those she loved. Consequently she was angry;
angry with Wanaha, angry with the Indians, but
most of all with herself. Wanaha had asked for a
secret visit to Nevil Steyne, who was cutting wood
below the bridge.</p>
<p>But in spite of her anger, as she made the necessary
detour for concealment in one of those deep
troughs amid the billows of grass-land, there was a
sparkle of anticipation and excitement in her violet
eyes. Before she was half-way to the woods that
lined the river the last shadow of her brief anger had
passed from her face. After all, she told herself in
weak excuse, what she was doing was only a very
little matter, and, perhaps&mdash;who could tell?&mdash;she
might learn something that would be useful to Seth,
who cared for nothing and nobody in the world but
the Indians. So she rode on quite fearless, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
no graver qualms than the very slightest twinge of
conscience.</p>
<p>As she rode she debated with herself the manner
in which she was to conceal her destination from
chance observers. Wilful and irresponsible as Rosebud
always appeared to be, there was yet something
strongly reliant in her nature. She was, as so many
girls are, a child in thought and deed until some
great event, perchance some bereavement, some
tragedy, or some great love, should come to rouse
the dormant strength for good or ill which lies hidden
for years, sometimes for life, in nearly every daughter
of Eve.</p>
<p>The result of her debate was a decision to head
for the ford when once she was out of view of the
farm. She argued, if Nevil Steyne were cutting
wood below the bridge, as Wanaha had told her,
then by entering the woods at the ford she could
make her way through them until she came to him.
Thus she would not show herself near his hut, or
near where he might be known to be working.</p>
<p>So, in the waning daylight, she cantered over the
scented grass without a thought of the danger which
Wanaha had hinted to her. She was defenceless,
unarmed, yet utterly fearless. Her spirit was of the
plains, fresh, bright, strong. Life to her was as the
rosy light of dawn, full of promise and hope. Her
frail figure, just budding with that enchanting promise
of magnificent womanhood, swaying to the light
gait of her broncho, was a sight to stir the pulse of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
any man. It was no wonder that the patient, serious
Seth watched over her, shielding her with every
faculty alert, every nerve straining, all his knowledge
of that living volcano over which they lived brought
into service.</p>
<p>Some such thoughts as these may have passed
through Charlie Rankin&#8217;s mind when he saw her as
he passed on his way to the farm. For men are like
this. Married or single they always have an eye for
feminine beauty, only when they are married they
generally keep their observations to themselves&mdash;if
they be wise.</p>
<p>The sun was almost upon the horizon when the
girl reached the ford. The rift in the woods, which
formed a wagon trail, was very narrow, and even
though the sun had not yet set, the spot was dark
and sombre by reason of the wall of pine trees which
lined it upon each side.</p>
<p>Just for a second Rosebud experienced the dark
moody influence of the gloomy pine canopy beneath
which she was to plunge. Like all high-spirited
creatures she had no love for any form of gloom.
And there is nothing in nature that can compare
with the American pinewoods for gloom. Stately,
magnificent, if you will, but funereal in their gloom.</p>
<p>Something of her surroundings now found reflection
in the expression of her fair face as she plunged
down the solemn aisles of black, barren tree trunks,
like columns supporting the superstructure of some
Gothic cathedral.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>Her broncho was forced to take his way carefully,
and thus his gait was reduced to little better than a
walk. Further in, the tree-trunks gave way occasionally
to patches of undergrowth. Then they became
mixed with other growths. Maple and spruce held
place and made her course more awkward, and
further hindered her. The blue gums crowded so
closely that frequently she was driven to considerable
detour. Gradually the maze began to confuse
her. She started to reckon the whereabouts of the
river, a process which confused her more. But she
kept on, her whole attention concentrated,&mdash;so much
so that even her object was almost forgotten.</p>
<p>So engrossed was she that she failed to notice that
her horse had suddenly become very alert. His
large, low-bred ears, that weathercock of the horseman,
were pricked up, and he looked inquiringly
from side to side as he picked his way. Once he
gave a short, suppressed whinny.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s perplexity, however, was strong upon
her. She did not hear it, or, if she did, it conveyed
nothing to her. Her brows were puckered, and she
gazed only ahead. Had she paused she must have
heard that which had drawn her horse&#8217;s attention.
But she kept on, struggling with the maze about her,
and so heard no sound of the breaking brush upon
either side of her.</p>
<p>She was more than half-way to the bridge, when,
to her intense relief, she saw daylight ahead through
the overshadowing foliage. She pushed on urgently,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
and sighed her relief; it was a clearing. That opening
meant more to her than she would have admitted.
To see the sky again, to breathe air that was fresh,
free from the redolence of the forest underlay, was all
she desired.</p>
<p>The clearing was fringed with a low, thorny brush,
which, as she came to it, caught her skirt, and forced
her to draw rein, and stoop to release it.</p>
<p>While thus occupied her broncho threw up his head
and gave a tremendous neigh. The sound startled
her, as these things will startle the strongest when
all is profoundly silent. But what followed was more
startling still. Not one, but half a dozen echoes at
least responded, and, with a thrill, the girl sat up.
The next moment she had spurred her horse and
charged, regardless of the thorns, into the midst of
the clearing.</p>
<p>As she came a wave of horror swept over her.
Simultaneous with her entry a mounted Indian appeared
from the opposite side. Others appeared,
each from a different direction, silent, but with automatic
precision. To her right she saw them; to her
left; and behind her, too. A deliberate ring of silent
sentries had formed themselves about her, almost in
the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s first terror was almost overwhelming,
and her impulse was to shriek aloud. But the shock
of that ghostly appearance passed, not because the
danger appeared to lessen, but because her nerves
were healthy, and she somehow possessed sympathy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
with the red men. Mechanically she noticed, too,
that they were blanketed, as in peace. They had
donned no feathers or paint. Nor could she see
aught of any firearms. So her courage returned, but
she did not attempt to move or speak.</p>
<p>She was not long left in doubt. With crude, dramatic
effect Little Black Fox suddenly appeared from
the adjacent woods. He rode into the ring on his
black pony, sitting the sleek beast in that haughty
manner which is given to the Indian alone, and which
comes from the fact that he uses no saddle, and sits
with the natural pose of a lithe figure that is always
carried erect.</p>
<p>He wore no blanket. He was clad from head to
foot resplendent in beaded buckskin, his long black
hair flowing beneath his crown of feathers and falling
upon his shoulders. His handsome face was unscarred
by any barbaric markings such as many of
his warriors displayed. He was fresh and young;
his eyes were flashing with deep emotion, and lit up
his dusky countenance with a smile that had nothing
gentle in it. He was every inch a chief. Nor was
there any mistaking the barbaric lover that looked
out of his eyes.</p>
<p>Rosebud unconsciously drew herself up. There
was no responsive smile upon her face. She knew
there was mischief looming, and the woman in her
was stirred to the depths. Young as she was she
realized that that ring of sentries about her could
mean but one thing. Now, when it was too late, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
recalled Seth&#8217;s many warnings, and bitterly repented
her unutterable folly in ever going near this wild,
untried young chieftain.</p>
<p>She kept silent. But the seconds that passed as
the man rode up were trying. He rode to within six
inches of her, and their horses stood head to tail.
Then he spoke in his native Sioux tongue, which so
lends itself to the expression of ardent passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sun has no brightness like the eyes of the
paleface princess,&#8221; he said, his proud face serious,
and his eyes steady and flashing. There was almost
a flush under the dusky skin of his cheeks. &#8220;The
waters of the great lakes are deep, but the depth is
as nothing to the blue of the princess&#8217;s eyes. She is
queen of her race, as Little Black Fox is king of his
race. The king would wed the queen, whose eyes
make little the cloudless summer sky. He loves
her, and is the earth beneath her feet. He loves
her, and all his race shall be her servants. He loves
her, and all that is his is hers. So there shall be
everlasting peace with her people and his. His
heart is swept with a passion which is like to the
fiercest blizzard of the plain. But its blast is hot;
hotter and swifter than the fiercest heats of earth.
There is no peace for him without the white princess.
He is ever at war. The body fights with the brain,
and his heart is torn. So he would wed the princess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even in her extremity something of the real passion
of this wild youth found a chord of sympathy
in Rosebud&#8217;s heart. His sincerity, his splendid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
personality, savage though he was, made her listen
attentively. The woman in her was not insensible
to his address, but the very truth of his passion
roused her fears again to the topmost pitch. There
was no mistaking those horsemen surrounding her.
She gave one little helpless glance around at them
that surely would have melted the heart of any
white man. But the impassive faces held out no
hope to her. She was at this man&#8217;s mercy.</p>
<p>Now, oddly enough, when she might have been
expected to cry out in her terror, her anger rose.
That quick rising anger which Seth understood so
well and smiled at. And she spoke without a
shadow of fear in her tone. Her use of the Sioux
tongue was not perfect, and her words gained force
therefrom.</p>
<p>&#8220;The princess cannot wed the chief,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;It is not according to the law of the palefaces.
Go&mdash;go back to your tepees, and the squaws of your
race. Leave me to go in peace. I have to go back
to my people.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s pause, during which a
dog&#8217;s yelp might have been heard by any less occupied.
The sound was such as is the yelp of a
foxhound drawing a cover. The chief&#8217;s face had
changed its expression; his passion was subservient
to his native ferocity, and his face displayed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have asked,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I, Little Black Fox,
who am chief. I have said come to me. The paleface
girl treats me like any dog. So. I have done.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
The spirit of Big Wolf, my father, enters my body.
Like him, who took the princess and held her for his
son, I will take that for which I have asked. There
shall be no peace with your race.&#8221;</p>
<p>He raised an arm to seize her by the waist. The
girl saw his intention, and a wild fear dilated her
eyes. But she did not lose her head. She suddenly
spurred her broncho with a little vicious stab. The
animal, already on his mettle, charged forward
desperately, taking the pony of the Indian facing it
in the chest and throwing it back upon its haunches.
But the chief was round like lightning. He saw
nothing, heeded nothing but the possible escape of
this white girl, and that he had no intention of permitting.
Had he been less engrossed he would
have seen a dog rush madly into the clearing, and,
in the manner of a cattle dog, incontinently begin a
savage assault on the heels of the Indians&#8217; ponies.
No human intelligence could have conceived a more
effective plan, for the braves were thrown into utter
confusion.</p>
<p>Little Black Fox came up with the fugitive, and,
leaning over, caught the girl in his strong young
arms. He meant to lift her from the saddle, but he
held her thus only for a bare second. There was the
sharp crack of a revolver, and Rosebud felt his grasp
relax. He sat up on his horse and looked about him
fiercely, then he reeled and clutched his pony&#8217;s mane,
while Seth, shouting encouragement to the terrified
girl, came at him from out of the woods.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>He came with such a cry of rage and fury that his
voice was almost unrecognizable. His face, usually
so calm, was flaming. His smoking revolver was
raised aloft and, as his horse charged into that of
the wounded chief, it fell crashing on to the befeathered
head, and the man went down like a log.</p>
<p>&#8220;You gol durned black heathen!&#8221; Seth cried.
Then his rage died out before the greater emergency.
&#8220;Ride, Rosebud! The woods, and turn left. Ride
like hell!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was all he had time for. He turned again in
time to empty another chamber of his gun into the
stomach of an Indian, who came at him with an
upraised axe. Then, as the man rolled from his
horse, he saw that the rest had discarded their
blankets&mdash;their wearing of which had probably
saved him&mdash;and now meant battle to the death.</p>
<p>He fully realized that he had no chance of escape,
but he meant to give them all he could before the
end came. One Indian raised a queer old rifle at
him, but he let it drop before it was discharged.
Another bullet had found its billet in the pit of the
man&#8217;s stomach.</p>
<p>General, who had taken himself off when Rosebud
departed, now returned to the scene. He came with
his fierce, canine worrying just as the rest of the
Indians charged their solitary adversary. His
diversion helped to check their onslaught, but only
for a second. They had abandoned their firearms
in favor of their native weapons as they came.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>Seth was powerless against such odds. There
was no hope. His revolver cracked and more than
one man fell, but they closed with him, and, as his
last barrel was emptied, he felt the flesh of his left
shoulder rip under the slashing blow of an axe. His
horse reared and for the moment took him clear of
the horde, and at the same instant, he heard the
deep tones of Rube&#8217;s voice shouting to him. The
Indians heard it, too. They turned, and the fire of
revolvers from this new direction greeted them.
They could murder one man, but reinforcements
were different. It was enough. As Rube and
Charlie Rankin galloped into the clearing they
broke and fled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rosebud?&#8221; cried Rube in a voice of agonized
suspense.</p>
<p>Seth had swung his horse round and led the way
out of the clearing in the track the girl had taken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; he cried. And, in a moment, the
battle ground was deserted by all but the wounded
Indians.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE LETTER FROM ENGLAND</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;La, child, an&#8217; why did you go for to do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma was bending over Seth, bathing the ugly flesh
wound in his shoulder. Her old eyes were pathetically
anxious behind her spectacles, but her touch
was sure and steady. Her words were addressed to
Rosebud, who was standing by with a handful of
bandages. The girl made no reply, and her eyes
were fixed on this result of her escapade. She was
pale, and her young face looked drawn. The violet
of her eyes was noticeably dull, and it was easy to
see that she was struggling hard to keep tears back.
She simply could not answer.</p>
<p>Seth took the task upon himself. He seemed to
understand, although he was not looking her way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worrit the gal, Ma,&#8221; he said, in his gentle
fashion, so that Rosebud felt like dropping the
bandages and fleeing from the room. &#8220;Say, jest
git right to it an&#8217; fix me up. I &#8217;low ther&#8217;s li&#8217;ble to be
work doin&#8217; &#8217;fore this night&#8217;s out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God a-mussy, I hope not, Seth, boy!&#8221; the old
woman said, with a deep intake of breath. But her
busy fingers hastened. She tenderly laid the wool,
saturated in carbolic oil, upon the gash. Seth bore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
it without flinching. &#8220;More&#8217;n six year,&#8221; she added,
taking the bandages from Rosebud and applying
them with the skill of long experience, &#8220;an&#8217; we&#8217;ve
had no trouble, thank God. But I knew it &#8217;ud come
sure. Rube had it in his eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wher&#8217;s Rube now?&#8221; asked Seth, cutting her
short.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doin&#8217; guard out front.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bandage was adjusted, and Seth rose and was
helped into his coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll git out to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He found it hard, for once, to sit in there with the
womenfolk. His feeling was one common to men
of action.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re feelin&#8217; easy?&#8221; Ma asked him anxiously,
as he moved to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead right, Ma.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old woman shook her head doubtfully, and
Rosebud&#8217;s troubled eyes followed him as he moved
away. She had scarcely spoken since they returned
to the house. Her brain was still in a whirl and she
was conscious of a weak, but almost overpowering,
inclination to tears. The one thing that stood out
above all else in her thoughts was Seth&#8217;s wound.</p>
<p>No one had questioned her; no one had blamed
her. These simple people understood her feelings
of the moment too well. Later they knew they
would learn all about it. For the present there was
plenty to be done.</p>
<p>Rube had been making preparations. Their plans
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
needed no thinking out. Such an emergency as the
present had always been foreseen, and so there was
no confusion. Charlie Rankin had gone on to old
Joe Smith, and that individual would be dispatched
post-haste in the direction of the white tents that had
been seen on the plains. For the rest the horses in
the barn were ready harnessed, and Ma could be
trusted to get together the household things ready
for decamping. There was nothing to do but to
keep a night-long watch.</p>
<p>Seth had crossed the passage, and was passing
through the parlor, out of which the front door
opened. Rosebud hesitated. Then with something
almost like a rush she followed him. She was at his
side in a moment, and her two small hands were
clasping his rough, strong right hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth,&#8221; she whispered, tearfully. &#8220;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, little Rosie!&#8221; the man interrupted, attempting
to draw his hand gently from her grasp.
&#8220;Guess ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no need to say anything. Mebbe
I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Seth had misinterpreted her action. He
thought she meant to explain. She kept hold of his
hand, and tears were in her lovely eyes as she looked
up into his dark face, now little more than a shadow
in the faint light that came from the passage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Seth, Seth, it was all my fault!&#8221; she cried,
in her distress. &#8220;Your poor shoulder! Oh, what
should I do if you were to die! Oh&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And the
girl fell on her knees at his side and kissed the hand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
she was clinging to. The long threatened tears
had come at last, and her voice was choked with
sobs.</p>
<p>Seth had been unprepared for this outburst. It
took him quite aback, and he felt a great lump rise
in his throat. Unconsciously he almost roughly released
his hand. But the next moment it was laid
tenderly upon the bowed head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git up, little gal,&#8221; he said. And there was a
world of tenderness in his voice. His effort at self-restraint
was great, but his feelings found a certain
amount of expression in spite of him, for he was
stirred to the depths of his loyal heart. He was face
to face with a scene such as he had never even
pictured. His sense of duty was powerless just then
before his deep, strong love for the girl. &#8220;Little
Rosebud,&#8221; he went on, and he struggled hard to
make his words rough, &#8220;ther&#8217;s things to do. Go
right back to Ma an&#8217; help her. I must go out to
Rube. He&#8217;s doin&#8217; all the work, an&#8217; so is she.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl made no move to rise. Her sobs were
heart-breaking. Seth turned sharply and left her
where she was. He simply dared not stay there
another moment.</p>
<p>Outside General was lying a few yards away from
the house, crouched alertly, and gazing out prairiewards.
He called the dog to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Injuns, boy,&#8221; he said, in a low tone. &#8220;S-seek
&#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dog responded with a low growl, and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
moved off out into the darkness, with the prowling
gait of a puma stalking its prey.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll keep us posted,&#8221; Seth observed quietly to
Rube.</p>
<p>&#8220;You kind o&#8217; understan&#8217; him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He understands Injuns,&#8221; the dog&#8217;s master returned
significantly. No more was said for a while,
and the two men peered out into the darkness with
eyes trained to such watchfulness.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout them tents?&#8221; said Rube later on.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re the troops. The postmaster told me
they were comin&#8217; hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind o&#8217; handy.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was very dark. The moon had not yet risen.
Presently Seth fetched a chair. The older man
watched him seat himself a little wearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt some?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest a notion,&#8221; Seth replied in his briefest manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you got around jest in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yup. Wanaha put me wise after I left here, so
I came that aways. Say, this is jest the beginnin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217;s more comin&#8217;. Guess the troops &#8217;ll check
it some. But&mdash;say, this feller&#8217;s worse&#8217;n his father.
Guess he&#8217;s jest feelin&#8217; his feet. An&#8217; he&#8217;s gettin&#8217; all the
Pine Ridge lot with him&mdash;I located that as I came
along.&#8221;</p>
<p>They talked on for some time longer, in their slow,
short way discussing their plans. The one topic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
they did not discuss was Rosebud. They tacitly ignored
her share in the evening&#8217;s work like men who
knew that certain blame must attach to her and refused
to bestow it.</p>
<p>The night dragged slowly on. Rube wanted Seth
to go in and rest, but Seth sat in his chair with dogged
persistence. So they shared the vigil.</p>
<p>Rube, by way of variation, occasionally visited the
stables to see to the horses. And all the time the dog
was out scouting with an almost human intelligence.
After once being dispatched he did not appear
again. Seth had brought him up to this Indian
scouting, and the beast&#8217;s natural animosity to the Indians
made him a perfect guard.</p>
<p>The moon rose at midnight. There was no sign of
disturbance on the Reservation. All was quiet and
still. But then these men knew that the critical time
had not yet arrived. Dawn would be the danger.
And by dawn they both hoped that something might
result from Charlie Rankin&#8217;s journey.</p>
<p>Rube was sitting in a chair at Seth&#8217;s side. The
clock in the kitchen had just cuckooed three times.
The old man&#8217;s eyes were heavy with sleep, but he
was still wide awake. Neither had spoken for some
time. Suddenly Seth&#8217;s right hand gripped the old
man&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a faint, uneasy whine far out on the
prairie. Then Seth&#8217;s straining ears caught the sound
of horses galloping. Rube sprang to his feet, and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
hands went to the guns at his waist. But Seth
checked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Guess it ain&#8217;t that. General
only whined. He mostly snarls wicked for Injuns.&#8221;</p>
<p>They listened again. And soon it became apparent
that those approaching were coming out of
the north.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charlie&#8217;s located &#8217;em.&#8221; Seth&#8217;s tone was quietly
assuring, and old Rube sighed his relief.</p>
<p>Then the dog suddenly reappeared. He, too,
seemed to understand that friends were approaching.</p>
<p>And so it proved. The night of long suspense
was over. A few minutes later a squad of United
States cavalry, in charge of a dapper, blue-coated
lieutenant, rode up to the farm. And when they
arrived Seth was there by himself to receive them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rube Sampson&#8217;s farm?&#8221; inquired the lieutenant,
as he swung from his steaming horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right.&#8221; Seth shook hands with the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble over there,&#8221; observed the other, indicating
the Reservation with a nod of the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yup. Come right in. Guess your boys had
best make their plugs snug in the barn. Come
right in, and I&#8217;ll rouse Ma.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those last two hours before morning were the
hardest part of all to Rube and Seth, for, in the parlor,
they had to detail all the events of the preceding
day to Lieutenant Barrow and his sergeant. And
neither of them was good at explaining.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>Breakfast was partaken of; after which, since the
soldiers had accepted all responsibility, Ma packed
her men-folk off to bed. Seth had not seen a bed
since Friday night, and this was Tuesday.</p>
<p>The neighborhood of the farm, and, in fact, all
along the north side of the river presented an unusual
sight when Seth and Rube reappeared at noon.
Two regiments of United States cavalry had taken
up their position ready for any emergency.</p>
<p>The midday meal was a little late, so that Seth&#8217;s
shoulder might be properly dressed. And when at
last the family sat down to it, it threatened to be
more than usually silent. All were weary, and the
women overwrought. Ma was the only one who
made any attempt to rouse the drooping spirits
about her. The men knew that they were confronted
with no ordinary Indian rising. There was
something far more threatening to them personally.</p>
<p>As the meal dragged on Ma abandoned her efforts
entirely, and a long silence ensued. Finally Rube
pushed back his chair and rose from the table.
Then it was that Seth spoke for the first time.</p>
<p>He looked from Rube to Ma. He was trying to
look unconcerned, and even smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;guess I was fergittin&#8217;. I
got a bit of a letter from&mdash;England.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rube dropped back into his chair, and his eyes
were questioning. Ma was staring through her
spectacles at her boy. She, too, was asking a mute
question. But hers was merely a quiet curiosity,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
while Rube&#8217;s, slow old Rube&#8217;s, was prompted by
Seth&#8217;s manner, which, instinctively, he knew to be a
false one.</p>
<p>Rosebud was patting General&#8217;s head as he sat at
her side. She continued her caressing, but her eyes,
swift and eager but tenderly grave, watched Seth as
he drew out the letter from his pocket and smoothed
it upon the table. There was just the slightest
tremor in her hand as it rested on the dog&#8217;s
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yup,&#8221; Seth went on, with a great assumption of
unconcern which deceived nobody. &#8220;It&#8217;s a feller&mdash;jest
one o&#8217; them law fellers. He&#8217;s comin&#8217; right along
to the farm. I &#8217;low he must be nigh here now.
He was goin&#8217; to git here Tuesday the 16th&mdash;that&#8217;s
to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was intent on the letter. Nor did he once
raise his eyes while he was speaking. Now he
turned the paper as though in search of some detail
of interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Here it is. Says he&#8217;s hit the
trail o&#8217; some gal as was lost. Guesses he&#8217;d like to
see&mdash;Rosebud, an&#8217; ask a few questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma had risen, and somehow her chair overturned
behind her. Her exclamation was a gasp. Rube
stared; he had no words just then. Rosebud continued
to caress the dog, who whined his pleasure at
the unusual attention. At last she turned. For an
instant her eyes met Seth&#8217;s.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;May I read that letter, Seth?&#8221; she asked
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221; Seth rose from the table. &#8220;Rube,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I&#8217;d take it friendly if you&#8217;d fill my pipe.&#8221;
Then he moved across to the window.</p>
<p>Rosebud looked up from reading the letter. She
came round to him and handed it back.</p>
<p>&#8220;So my name&#8217;s Marjorie Raynor?&#8221; she said with
a queer smile.</p>
<p>Seth nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;And all this money is what you once spoke
about?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again came Seth&#8217;s affirmation.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how long have you known&mdash;that I&#8217;m not
Rosebud?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got that bit of a letter Saturday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you guessed it long before that&mdash;when we
were out at the slough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d a notion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl glanced round. Ma&#8217;s face was still in a
condition of florid perplexity. Rube was quietly
whittling a match with his tobacco knife. Rosebud&#8217;s
eyes were very soft as she looked from one to
the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m to go away from&mdash;here?&#8221; she said at
last, and her lips were trembling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess when a &#8217;stray&#8217; comes along we mostly
git it back home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth found a lot to interest him in the blank wall
of the barn outside the window.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But it seems I&#8217;m a stray without a home. My
father and mother must be dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217;s aunts an&#8217; things&mdash;an&#8217; the dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl also surveyed the wall of the barn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I forgot the&mdash;dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly she turned away. Just for a moment
she seemed in some doubt of her own purpose.
Then she walked over to Ma and put her arms
about her neck and kissed her. Then she passed
round to Rube and did the same. Finally she
opened the door, and stood for a second looking at
Seth&#8217;s slim back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Farewell, friends. The heiress must prepare for
her departure.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was something harsh and hysterical about
the laugh which accompanied her mocking farewell,
but she was gone the next instant, and the door
slammed behind her.</p>
<p>Ma stepped up to her boy, and forgetful of his
wounded shoulder rested her hand upon it. Seth
flinched and drew away; and the old woman was
all sympathy at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m real sorry, boy, I kind o&#8217; forgot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothin&#8217;, Ma; it jest hurts some.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>SETH&#8217;S DUTY ACCOMPLISHED</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great country. It astonishes me at every
turn, madam; but it&#8217;s too stirring for me. One gets
used to things, I know, but this,&#8221; with a wave of the
arm in the direction of the Reservations, &#8220;these hair-raising
Indians! Bless me, and you live so close to
them!&#8221;</p>
<p>The crisp-faced, gray-headed little lawyer smiled in
a sharp, angular manner in Ma Sampson&#8217;s direction.
The farmwife, arrayed in her best mission-going
clothes, was ensconced in her husband&#8217;s large parlor
chair, which was sizes too big for her, and smiled
back at him through her glasses.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Irvine, the junior partner of the firm
of solicitors, Rodgers, Son, and Irvine, of London,
had made his final statement with regard to Rosebud,
and had now given himself up to leisure.</p>
<p>There had been no difficulty. Seth&#8217;s letter had
stated all the facts of which he had command. It
had been handed on to these solicitors. And what
he had told them had been sufficient to bring one of
the partners out to investigate. Nor had it taken
this practical student of human nature long to realize
the honesty of these folk, just as it had needed but
one glance of comparison between Rosebud and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
portrait of Marjorie Raynor, taken a few weeks before
her disappearance, and which he had brought
with him, to do the rest. The likeness was magical.
The girl had scarcely changed at all, and it was difficult
to believe that six years had elapsed since the
taking of that portrait. After a long discussion with
Seth the lawyer made his final statement to the assembled
family.</p>
<p>&#8220;You quite understand that this case must go
through the courts,&#8221; he said gravely. &#8220;There is
considerable property involved. For you, young
lady, a long and tedious process. However, the
matter will be easier than if there were others fighting
for the estate. There are no others, because the
will is entirely in your favor, in case of your mother&#8217;s
death. You have some cousins, and an aunt or
two, all prepared to welcome you cordially; they are
in no way your opponents; they will be useful in the
matter of identification. The only other relative is
this lost uncle. In taking you back to England I
assume sole responsibility. I am convinced myself,
therefore I unhesitatingly undertake to escort you,
and, if you care to accept our hospitality, will hand
you over to the charge of Mrs. Irvine and my
daughters. And should the case go against you, a
contingency which I do not anticipate for one moment,
I will see that you return to your happy home
here in perfect safety. I hope I state my case clearly,
Mr. Sampson, and you, Mr. Seth. I,&#8221; and the little
man tapped the bosom of his shirt, &#8220;will personally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
guarantee Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Marjorie Raynor&#8217;s safety and
comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Irvine beamed in his angular fashion upon
Rosebud, in a way that emphatically said, &#8220;There,
by that I acknowledge your identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this man who felt sure, that, at much discomfort
to himself, he was bringing joy into a poor
household, was grievously disappointed, for one and
all received his assurances as though each were a
matter for grief. Seth remained silent, and Rube
had no comment to offer. Rosebud forgot even to
thank him.</p>
<p>Ma alone rose to the occasion, and she only by a
great effort. But when the rest had, on various pretexts,
drifted out of the parlor, she managed to give
the man of law a better understanding of things.
She gave him an insight into their home-life, and
hinted at the grief this parting would be to them all,
even to Rosebud. And he, keen man of business
that he was, encouraged her to talk until she had told
him all, even down to the previous night&#8217;s work on
the banks of the White River. Like many women
who trust rather to the heart than to the head, Ma
had thus done for Rosebud what no purely business
procedure could have done. She had enlisted this
cool-headed but kindly lawyer&#8217;s sympathies. And
that goes far when a verdict has to be obtained.</p>
<p>In response to the lawyer&#8217;s horrified realization of
the dangerous adjacency of the Reservations, Ma
laughed in her gentle, assured manner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it seems queer to you, Mr. Irvine, but it
isn&#8217;t to us. We are used to it. As my Rube always
says, says he, &#8217;When our time comes ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no
kickin&#8217; goin&#8217; to be done. Meanwhiles we&#8217;ll keep a
smart eye, an&#8217; ther&#8217;s allus someun lookin&#8217; on to see
fair play.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The old woman&#8217;s reply gave this man, who had
never before visited any place wilder than a European
capital, food for reflection. This was his first glimpse
of pioneer life, and he warmed toward the spirit, the
fortitude which actuated these people. But he made
a mental resolve that the sooner Miss Raynor was
removed from the danger zone the better.</p>
<p>There was little work done on the farm that day.
When Seth had finished with the lawyer he abruptly
took himself away and spent most of the day among
the troops. For one thing, he could not stay in the
home which was so soon to lose Rosebud. It was
one matter for him to carry out the duty he conceived
to be his, and another to stand by and receive in
silence the self-inflicted chastisement it brought with
it. So, with that quiet spirit of activity which was
his by nature, and which served him well now, he
took his share in the work of the troops, for which
his knowledge and experience so fitted him. The
most experienced officers were ready to listen to him,
for Seth was as well known in those disturbed regions
as any of the more popular scouts who have found
their names heading columns in the American daily
press.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>After supper he and Rube devoted themselves to
the chores of the farm, and it was while he was occupied
in the barn, and Rube was attending to the
milch cows in another building, that he received an
unexpected visit. He was working slowly, his
wounded shoulder handicapping him sorely, for he
found difficulty in bedding down the horses with
only one available hand. Hearing a light footstep
coming down the passage between the double row
of stalls, he purposely continued his work.</p>
<p>Rosebud, for it was she, paused at the foot of the
stall in which he was working. He glanced round
and greeted her casually. The girl stood there a
second, then she turned away, and, procuring a
fork, proceeded to bed down the stall next to
him.</p>
<p>Seth protested at once. Rosebud had never been
allowed to do anything like this. His objection
came almost roughly, but the girl ignored it and
went on working.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, gal, quit right there,&#8221; he said, in an authoritative
manner.</p>
<p>Rosebud laughed. But the old spirit was no
longer the same. The light-hearted mirth had gone.
Indeed, Rosebud was a child no longer. She was a
woman, and it would have surprised these folk to
know how serious-minded the last two days had
made her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even a prisoner going to be hanged is allowed
to amuse himself as he pleases during his last hours,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
Seth,&#8221; she responded, pitching out the bedding
from under the manger with wonderful dexterity.</p>
<p>Seth flushed, and his eyes were anxious. No
physical danger could have brought such an expression
to them. It was almost as if he doubted
whether what he had done was right. It was the
doubt which at times assails the strongest, the most
decided. He seemed to be seeking a suitable response,
but his habit of silence handicapped him.
At last he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be hanged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so am I.&#8221; Rosebud fired her retort with
all the force of her suppressed passion. Then she
laughed again in that hollow fashion, and the straw
flew from her fork. &#8220;At least I am going out of
the world&mdash;my world, the world I love, the only
world I know. And for what?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth labored steadily. His tongue was terribly
slow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217;s your friends, and&mdash;the dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends&mdash;dollars?&#8221; she replied scornfully, while
the horse she was bedding moved fearfully away
from her fork. &#8220;You are always thinking of my
dollars. What do I want with dollars? And I am
not going to friends. I have no father and mother
but Pa and Ma. I have no friends but those who
have cared for me these last six years. Why has
this little man come out here to disturb me? Because
he knows that if the dollars are mine he will
make money out of me. He knows that, and for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
consideration he will be my friend. Oh, I hate him
and the dollars!&#8221;</p>
<p>The tide of the girl&#8217;s passion overwhelmed Seth,
and he hardly knew what to say. He passed into
another stall and Rosebud did the same. The man
was beginning to realize the unsuspected depths of
this girl&#8217;s character, and that, perhaps, after all, there
might have been another mode of treatment than his
line of duty as he had conceived it. He found an
answer at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, if I&#8217;d located this thing and had done
nothin&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began. And she caught him up at
once.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have thanked you,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But Seth saw the unreasonableness of her
reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Rosebud,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;you&#8217;re talkin&#8217;
foolish. An&#8217; you know it. What I did was only
right by you. I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; been a skunk to have acted
different. I lit on the trail o&#8217; your folk, don&#8217;t
matter how, an&#8217; I had to see you righted, come
what might. Now it&#8217;s done. An&#8217; I don&#8217;t see wher&#8217;
the hangin&#8217; comes in. Guess you ken come an&#8217; see
Ma later, when things get quiet agin. I don&#8217;t take
it she hates you a heap.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke almost cheerfully, trying hard to disguise
what he really felt. He knew that with this
girl&#8217;s going all the light would pass out of his life.
He dared not speak in any other way or his resolve
would melt before the tide of feeling which he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
struggling to repress. He would have given something
to find excuse to leave the barn, but he made
no effort to do so.</p>
<p>When Rosebud answered him her manner had
changed. Seth thought that it was due to the reasonableness
of his own arguments, but then his
knowledge of women was trifling. The girl had
read something underlying the man&#8217;s words which
he had not intended to be there, and had no knowledge
of having expressed. Where a woman&#8217;s affections
are concerned a man is a simple study, especially
if he permits himself to enter into debate. Seth&#8217;s
strength at all times lay in his silence. He was too
honest for his speech not to betray him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know, Seth, you are right and I am
wrong,&#8221; she said, and her tone was half laughing
and half crying, and wholly penitent. &#8220;That&#8217;s just
it, I am always wrong. I have done nothing but
bring you trouble. I am no help to you at all. Even
this fresh trouble with the Indians is my doing.
And none of you ever blame me. And&mdash;and I don&#8217;t
want to go away. Oh, Seth, you don&#8217;t know
how I want to stay! And you&#8217;re packing me off
like a naughty child. I am not even asked if I want
to go.&#8221; She finished up with that quick change to
resentment so characteristic of her.</p>
<p>The touch of resentment saved Seth. He found it
possible to answer her, which he did with an assumption
of calmness he in no way felt. It was a
pathetic little face that looked up into his. The girl&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
anger had brought a flush to her cheeks, but her
beautiful eyes were as tearful as an April sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess we&#8217;ve all got to do a heap o&#8217; things we
don&#8217;t like, Rosie; a mighty big heap. An&#8217; seems
to me the less we like &#8217;em the more sure it is they&#8217;re
right for us to do. Some folks calls it &#8217;duty.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you think it&#8217;s my duty to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;My duty, the same as it was your duty always
to help me out when I got into some scrape?&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a thought Seth nodded again, and was at
once answered by that hollow little laugh which he
found so jarring.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate duty! But, since I have had your splendid
example before me for six years, it has forced on me
the necessity of trying to be like you.&#8221; The girl&#8217;s
sarcasm was harsh, but Seth ignored it.</p>
<p>As she went on her mood changed again. &#8220;I
was thinking while that old man was talking so
much,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;how I shall miss Pa, and
Ma, and old General. And I can&#8217;t bear the idea of
leaving even the horses and cattle, and the grain
fields. I don&#8217;t know whatever the little papooses at
the Mission will do without me. I wonder if all the
people who do their duty feel like that about things?
They can&#8217;t really, or they wouldn&#8217;t want to do it,
and would just be natural and&mdash;and human sometimes.
Think of it, Seth, I&#8217;m going to leave all this
beautiful sunshine for the fog of London just for the
sake of duty. I begin to feel quite good. Then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
you see, when I&#8217;m rich I shall have so much to do
with my money&mdash;so many duties&mdash;that I shall have
no time to think of White River Farm at all. And
if I do happen to squeeze in a thought, perhaps just
before I go to sleep at night, it&#8217;ll be such a comfort
to think everybody here is doing their duty. You
see nothing else matters, does it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth took refuge in silence. The girl&#8217;s words
pained him, but he knew that it was only her grief
at leaving, and he told himself that her bitterness
would soon pass. The pleasure of traveling, of seeing
new places, the excitement of her new position
would change all that. Receiving no reply Rosebud
went on, and her bitterness merged into an assumed
brightness which quite deceived her companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;after all it won&#8217;t be so
dreadful, will it? I can buy lots of nice things, and
I shall have servants. And I can go all over the
world. No more washing up. And there&#8217;ll be
parties and dances. And Mr. Irvine said something
about estates. I suppose I&#8217;ll have a country house&mdash;like
people in books. Yes, and I&#8217;ll marry some
one with a title, and wear diamonds. Do you
think somebody with a title would marry me,
Seth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe, if you asked him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, you see it&#8217;s only fine ladies gits asked by
fellers as has titles.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dense Seth felt easier in his mind at the girl&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
tone, and in his clumsy fashion was trying to join in
the spirit of the thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, I&#8217;ll not ask any one to marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth realized his mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Course not. I was jest foolin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221; Rosebud was smiling, and a dash of
mischief was in her eyes as she went on&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be awful if a girl had to ask some one
to marry her, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth moved out into the passage; the last horse
was bedded down, and they stood together leaning
on their forks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man would be a silly, wouldn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A reg&#8217;lar hobo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a &#8217;hobo,&#8217; Seth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, jest a feller who ain&#8217;t got no &#8216;savee.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Savee&#8217; means &#8217;sense,&#8217; doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Rosebud&#8217;s
eyes were innocently inquiring, and they gazed
blandly up into the man&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, not exac&#8217;ly. It&#8217;s when a feller don&#8217;t git a
notion right, an&#8217; musses things up some.&#8221; They
were walking toward the barn door now. Seth was
about to go up to the loft to throw down hay.
&#8220;Same as when I got seein&#8217; after the Injuns when I
ought to&#8217;ve stayed right here an&#8217; seen you didn&#8217;t go
sneakin&#8217; off by y&#8217;self down by the river,&#8221; he added
slyly, with one of his rare smiles.</p>
<p>The girl laughed and clapped her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Seth!&#8221; she cried, as she moved out to return
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
to the house, &#8220;then you&#8217;re a regular &#8217;hobo.&#8217;
What a joke!&#8221;</p>
<p>And she ran off, leaving the man mystified.</p>
<p>Rosebud and the lawyer left the following morning.
Never had such good fortune caused so much
grief. It was a tearful parting; Ma and Rosebud
wept copiously, and Rube, too, was visibly affected.
Seth avoided everybody as much as possible. He
drove the conveyance into Beacon Crossing, but, as
they were using the lawyer&#8217;s hired &#8220;democrat,&#8221; he
occupied the driving-seat with the man who had
brought the lawyer out to the farm. Thus it was
he spoke little to Rosebud on the journey.</p>
<p>Later, at the depot, he found many things to occupy
him and only time to say &#8220;good-bye&#8221; at the
last moment, with the lawyer looking on.</p>
<p>The girl was on the platform at the end of the
sleeping-car when Seth stepped up to make his farewell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, little Rosebud,&#8221; he said, in his quiet,
slow manner. His eyes were wonderfully soft.
&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll write some?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl nodded. Her violet eyes were suspiciously
bright as she looked frankly up into his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we shall both be happy. We&#8217;ve done
our duty, haven&#8217;t we?&#8221; she asked, with a wistful
little smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; replied Seth, with an ineffective attempt
at lightness.</p>
<p>The girl still held his hand and almost imperceptibly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
drew nearer to him. Her face was lifted to him
in a manner that few would have mistaken. But
Seth gently withdrew his hand, and, as the train began
to move, climbed down and dropped upon the
low platform.</p>
<p>Rosebud turned away with a laugh, though her
eyes filled with tears. She waved a handkerchief,
and Seth&#8217;s tall, slim figure was the last she beheld of
Beacon Crossing. And when the train was sufficiently
far away she kissed her hand in the direction
of the solitary figure still doing sentry at the extremity
of the platform. Then she went into the car and
gave full vent to the tears she had struggled so long
to repress.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>SETH PLAYS A STRONG HAND</h3>
</div>

<p>It would seem that the Agent&#8217;s prompt action in
summoning the aid of the troops had averted disaster.
No trouble followed immediately on Seth&#8217;s drastic
treatment of Little Black Fox, and the majority of
the settlers put this result down to the fact of the overawing
effect of the cavalry. One or two held different
opinions, and amongst these were the men of
White River Farm. They were inclined to the belief
that the wounding of the chief was the sole reason
that the people remained quiet. Anyway, not a shot
was fired, much to the satisfaction of the entire white
population, and, after two weeks had passed, by
slow degrees, a large proportion of the troops were
withdrawn.</p>
<p>Then followed a government inquiry, at which Seth
was the principal witness. It was a mere formality
by which the affair was relegated to the history of
the State. The government knew better than to
punish the chief. After all, Little Black Fox was a
king of his race, and, however much it might desire
to be rid of the turbulent Sioux, it would be a dangerous
thing to act with a high hand.</p>
<p>But the matter served as an excuse for one of those
mistakes which so often have a far-reaching effect.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
There was an old fort close by the Pine Ridge Reservation,
one of those ancient structures erected by
old-time traders. It had long been untenanted, and
had fallen into decay. The authorities decided to
make it habitable, and turn it into a small military
post, garrisoning it with a detachment of about one
hundred cavalry.</p>
<p>It was a mistake. And every white man of experience
in the district knew that it was so. Even
the Agents of the two Reservations sounded a warning
note. It is fatal to attempt to bluff the Indian.
Bluff and back the bluff. But a handful of cavalry
is no backing to any bluff. The older settlers shook
their heads; the more timorous dared to hope; even
old Roiheim, who would make profit by the adjacency
of soldiers, would willingly have foregone the
extra trade. Rube and Seth offered no comment
outside their own house; but their opinion was worth
considering.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t hurt a heap this side of Christmas,&#8221;
Rube said, on learning the decision.</p>
<p>And Seth pointed his remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not now, I guess. Mebbe spring &#8217;ll see
things.&#8221;</p>
<p>These two had struck at the heart of the thing.
It was late summer, and history has long since proved
that Indians never go out on the war-path with winter
coming on. Besides, Little Black Fox was not likely
to be well of his wound for months.</p>
<p>So the farmers went about their work again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
Rube and Seth took in their crops, and devoted spare
time to building operations. And the district of
White River continued its unobtrusive prosperity.</p>
<p>The loss of Rosebud was no small matter to Ma
Sampson&#8217;s little household. But these folk were far
too well inured to the hard life of the plains to voice
their troubles. They sometimes spoke of her over
their meals, but for the most part bore her silently in
their thoughts. And the place she occupied with
them was surely one that anybody might envy.</p>
<p>For Seth all the brightness of the last six years had
gone out of his life, and he fell back on the almost
stern devotion, which had always been his, toward
the old people who had raised him. That, and the
looking forward to the girl&#8217;s letters from England
practically made up his life. He never permitted
himself the faintest hope that he would see her again.
He had no thought of marriage with her. If nothing
else prevented, her fortune was an impassable barrier.
Besides he knew that she would be restored to that
life&mdash;&#8220;high-life,&#8221; was his word&mdash;to which she properly
belonged. He never thought or hinted to himself
that she would forget them, for he had no bitterness,
and was much too loyal to think of her otherwise
than as the most true-hearted girl. He simply believed
he understood social distinctions thoroughly.</p>
<p>But if he were slow in matters of love, it was his
only sloth. In action he was swift and thorough,
and his perception in all matters pertaining to the
plainsman&#8217;s life was phenomenal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>It was this disposition for swift action which sent
him one day, after the troops had withdrawn to their
new post, and the plains had returned to their usual
pastoral aspect, in search of Nevil Steyne. And it
was significant that he knew just when and where to
find his man.</p>
<p>He rode into a clearing in the woods down by the
river. The spot was about a mile below the wagon
bridge, where the pines grew black and ragged&mdash;a
touch of the primordial in the midst of a younger
growth. It was noon; a time when the plainsman
knew he would find the wood-cutter at leisure, taking
his midday meal, or lazing over a pipe. Nor
were his calculations far out.</p>
<p>Nevil was stretched full length beside the smouldering
embers on which his coffee billytin was steaming
out fragrant odors that blended pleasantly
with the resinous fragrance of these ancient woods.</p>
<p>He looked up at the sound of horse&#8217;s hoofs, and
there could be no doubt about the unfriendliness of
his expression when he recognized his visitor. He
dropped back again into his lounging attitude at
once, and his action was itself one of studied discourtesy.</p>
<p>Seth did not appear to notice anything. He surveyed
the clearing with a certain appreciation. The
vast timbers he beheld seemed of much more consequence
to him than the man who lived by their
destruction. However, he rode straight over to the
fire and dismounted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy?&#8221; he said, while he loosened the cinches
of his saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s brought you around?&#8221; asked Nevil, ungraciously
enough.</p>
<p>Seth turned toward the trees about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty tidy patch,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;We&#8217;re
wantin&#8217; big timbers up at the farm. Mebbe you&#8217;d
notion a contrac&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil had noted the loosening of the cinches. He
laughed shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not taking contracts, thanks. But I&#8217;ll sell
you wood which I cut at my pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cord-wood?&#8221; Seth shook his head. &#8220;Guess
we want timbers. Kind o&#8217; buildin&#8217; a corral around
the farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Making a fort of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil&#8217;s blue eyes followed the upward curling
wreath of smoke which dawdled on the still air
above the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yup.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fancy the Injuns are on the racket?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, &#8217;tain&#8217;t what they&#8217;re doin&#8217; now. But ther&#8217;
ain&#8217;t no tellin&#8217;, an&#8217; we&#8217;re slack since the harvest. I
&#8217;lows the notion&#8217;s tol&#8217;ble. Mebbe they&#8217;ll be quiet
some&mdash;now Rosebud&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a quiet emphasis on Seth&#8217;s final speculation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard she&#8217;d gone away for a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil looked searchingly at this man whom he
hated above all men.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gone for good,&#8221; Seth said, with an admirable
air of indifference.</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil suddenly sat up. Seth noted the fact
without even glancing in his direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, y&#8217; see she&#8217;s got folks in England. And
ther&#8217; is a heap o&#8217; dollars; an almighty heap. I
reckon she&#8217;d be a millionairess in this country.
Guess it takes a mighty heap o&#8217; bills to reckon a
million in your country.&#8221;</p>
<p>This expansiveness was so unusual in the man of
the plains that Nevil understood at once he had
come purposely to speak of Rosebud. He wondered
why. This was the first he had heard of Rosebud&#8217;s
good fortune, and he wished to know more. The
matter had been kept from everybody. Even
Wanaha had been kept in ignorance of it.</p>
<p>Seth seated himself on a fallen tree-trunk, and
now looked squarely into the wood-cutter&#8217;s thin,
mean face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Y&#8217; see it&#8217;s kind o&#8217; curious. I got that gal from
the Injuns more&#8217;n six years back, as you&#8217;ll likely remember.
Her folks, her father an&#8217; her ma, was
killed south o&#8217; the Reservations. Guess they were
kind o&#8217; big folk in your country. An&#8217; ther&#8217; was a
feller come along awhiles back all the way from
England to find her. He was a swell law feller;
he&#8217;d hit her trail, an&#8217; when he comes along he said
as she owned &#8217;states in your country, a whole heap.
Guess she&#8217;s to be treated like a queen. Dollars?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
Gee! She ken buy most everything. I &#8217;lows they
ken do it slick in your country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth paused to light his pipe. His manner was
exquisitely simple. The narration of the story of
the girl&#8217;s good fortune appeared to give him the
keenest pleasure. Nevil removed his pipe from his
lips and sat chewing the end of his ragged moustache.
There was an ugly look in his eyes as he
contemplated the ashes of his fire. He might have
been staring at the ashes of his own fortunes. However,
he contrived a faint smile when he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;ve found out her real name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Marjorie Raynor. Her father was Colonel
Landor Raynor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no question o&#8217; the dollars. She
hain&#8217;t no near folk &#8217;cep&#8217; an uncle, Stephen Raynor,
an&#8217; he don&#8217;t figger anyways, &#8217;cause the dollars are
left to her by will. He only comes in, the lawyer
feller says, if the gal was to die, or&mdash;or get killed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth had become quite reflective; he seemed to
find a curious pleasure in thus discussing the girl he
loved with a man he at no time had any use for.</p>
<p>Nevil stared uneasily. A quick, furtive glance at
Seth, who at that moment seemed to be watching
his horse, gave an inkling of his passing thought.
If a look could kill Seth would certainly have been a
dead man.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the whole thing&#8217;s a dead cinch for her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yup. Now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>Nevil gave a short laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;that matter with Little Black Fox.
But she brought it on herself. She encouraged him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth was round on him in a twinkling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he was encouraged&mdash;but not by her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who then?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was unmistakable derision in the wood-cutter&#8217;s
tone. Seth shrugged. A shadowy smile
played round his lips, but his eyes were quite
serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; he said, relapsing into his reflective
manner, &#8220;the whole thing&#8217;s mighty curious. Them
law fellers in your country are smartish. They&#8217;ve
located a deal. Don&#8217;t jest know how. They figger
that uncle feller is around either this State or Minnesota&mdash;likely
this one, seein&#8217; the Colonel was comin&#8217;
this aways when he got killed. We got yarnin&#8217;,
an&#8217; he was sayin&#8217; he thought o&#8217; huntin&#8217; out this uncle.
I guessed ther&#8217; wa&#8217;an&#8217;t much need, an&#8217; it might
set him wantin&#8217; the dollars. The law feller said he
wouldn&#8217;t get &#8217;em anyhow&mdash;&#8217;cep&#8217; the gal was dead.
We kind o&#8217; left it at that. Y&#8217; see the whole thing
for the uncle hung around that gal&mdash;bein&#8217; dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you think he might have had something&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
Nevil&#8217;s words came slowly, like a man
who realizes the danger of saying too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, it don&#8217;t seem possible, I guess. Them two
was killed by the Injuns, sure. An&#8217; she&mdash;I guess
she ain&#8217;t never seen him.&#8221;</p>
<p>A slight sigh escaped Nevil.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; he said deliberately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howsum, I guess I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to look around for
this feller. Y&#8217; see Rosebud&#8217;s li&#8217;ble to like him.
Mebbe he ain&#8217;t well heeled for dollars, an&#8217; she&#8217;s that
tender-hearted she might&mdash;I&#8217;ve got his pictur&#8217;.
Mebbe I&#8217;ll show it around&mdash;eh, what&#8217;s up?&#8221; Seth
inquired in his blandest tone.</p>
<p>Nevil suddenly sat up and there was a desperate
look in his eyes. But he controlled himself, and,
with an effort, spoke indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. I want another pipe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221; Seth fumbled through his pockets, talking
the while. &#8220;The pictur&#8217; was took when he was most
a boy. His hair was thick an&#8217; he hadn&#8217;t no moustache
nor nothin&#8217;, which kind o&#8217; makes things hard.
As I was sayin&#8217;, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to show it around some,
an&#8217; maybe some one &#8217;ll rec&#8217;nize the feller. That&#8217;s
why I got yarnin&#8217; to you. Mebbe you ken locate
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he said the last word he drew a photograph
from his pocket and thrust it into Nevil&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>The wood-cutter took it with a great assumption
of indifference, and found himself looking down on a
result of early photographic art. It was the picture
of a very young man with an overshot mouth and a
thin, narrow face. But, as Seth had said, he wore
no moustache, and his hair was still thick.</p>
<p>Nevil looked long at that picture, and once or
twice he licked his lips as though they were very
dry. All the time Seth&#8217;s steady eyes were upon his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
face, and the shadow of a smile was still about his
lips.</p>
<p>At last Nevil looked up and Seth&#8217;s eyes held his.
For a moment the two men sat thus. Then the
wood-cutter handed back the photograph and shifted
his gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen the original of that about these
parts,&#8221; he said a little hoarsely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t figger you had,&#8221; Seth replied, rising and
proceeding to tighten up the cinches of his saddle
preparatory to departing. &#8220;The lawyer feller gave
me that. Y&#8217; see it&#8217;s an old pictur&#8217;. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t as fancy
as they do &#8217;em now. Mebbe I&#8217;ll find him later on.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had swung into his saddle. Nevil had also
risen as though to proceed with his work.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be a good thing for him, since Rosebud
is so well disposed,&#8221; Nevil laughed; he had almost
recovered himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; observed Seth. &#8220;Or a mighty bad
thing. Y&#8217; can&#8217;t never tell how dollars &#8217;ll fix a man.
Dollars has a heap to answer for.&#8221;</p>
<p>And with this vague remark the plainsman rode
slowly away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>SETH PAYS</h3>
</div>

<p>As the weeks crept by and the torrid heat toned
down to the delightful temperature of the Indian
summer, news began to reach White River Farm
from England. After the first excitement of her arrival
had worn off, Rosebud settled down to a regular
correspondence.</p>
<p>Even her return to the scenes of her childhood in
no way aided her memory. It was all new to her.
As her letters often said, though she knew she was
grown up, yet, as far as memory served her, she was
still only six years old. Servants who had nursed
her as a baby, who had cared for her as a child of
ten, aunts who had lavished childish presents upon
her, cousins who had played with her, they were all
strangers, every one.</p>
<p>So she turned with her confidences to those she
knew;&mdash;those old people on the prairie of Dakota,
and that man who had been everything to her. To
these she wrote by every mail, giving details of the
progress of affairs, telling them of her new life, of
her pleasures, her little worries, never forgetting that
Ma and Pa were still her mother and father.</p>
<p>Thus they learned that the lawyer&#8217;s prophecies had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
been fulfilled. Rosebud was in truth her father&#8217;s
heiress. The courts were satisfied, and she was
burdened with heritage under certain conditions of
the will. These conditions she did not state, probably
a girlish oversight in the rush of events so
swiftly passing round her.</p>
<p>The winter stole upon the plains; that hard, relentless
winter which knows no yielding till spring
drives it forth. First the fierce black frosts, then
the snow, and later the shrieking blizzard, battling,
tearing for possession of the field, carrying death in
its breath for belated man and beast, and sweeping
the snow into small mountains about the lonely
prairie dwellings as though, in its bitter fury at the
presence of man, it would bury them out of sight
where its blast proved powerless to destroy them.
Christmas and New Year were past, that time of
peace and festivity which is kept up wherever man
sojourns, be it in city or on the plains.</p>
<p>Through these dark months Seth and Rube
worked steadily on building their stockade, hauling
the logs, cutting, splitting, joining. The weather
made no difference to them. The fiercest storm
disturbed them no further than to cause them to
set a life-line from house to barn, or to their work,
wherever that might be. No blizzard could drive
them within doors when work was to be done. This
was the life they knew, they had always lived, and
they accepted it uncomplainingly, just as they accepted
the fruits of the earth in their season.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>No warning sound came from the Indians. The
settlers forgot the recent episode, forgot the past,
which is the way of human nature, and lived in the
present only, and looked forward happily to the
future.</p>
<p>Seth and Rube minded their own affairs. They
were never the ones to croak. But their vigilance
never relaxed. Seth resumed his visits to the
Reservation as unconcernedly as though no trouble
had ever occurred. He went on with his Sunday
work at the Mission, never altering his tactics by
one iota. And in his silent way he learned all that
interested him.</p>
<p>He learned of Little Black Fox&#8217;s protracted recovery,
his lately developed moroseness. He knew
whenever a council of chiefs took place, and much
of what passed on these occasions. The presence of
Nevil Steyne at such meetings was a matter which
never failed to interest him. He was rarely seen in
the company of the Agent, yet a quiet understanding
existed between them, and he frequently possessed
news which only Parker could have imparted.</p>
<p>So it was clearly shown that whatever the general
opinion of the settlers, Seth, and doubtless Rube
also, had their own ideas on the calm of those
winter months, and lost no opportunity of verifying
them.</p>
<p>New Year found the ponderous stockade round
the farm only a little more than half finished in spite
of the greatest efforts. Rube had hoped for better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
results, but the logs had been slow in forthcoming.
The few Indians who would work in the winter had
been scarcer this year, and, in spite of the Agent,
whose duty it was to encourage his charges in accepting
and carrying out remunerative labor, the
work had been very slow.</p>
<p>At Rube&#8217;s suggestion it was finally decided to
seek white labor in Beacon Crossing. It was more
expensive, but it was more reliable. When once the
new project had been put into full working order it
was decided to abandon the Indian labor altogether.</p>
<p>With this object in view Seth went across to the
Reservation to consult Parker. He was met by the
Agent&#8217;s sister. Her brother was out, but she expected
him home to dinner, which would be in the
course of half an hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;He went off with Jim Crow,&#8221; the amiable spinster
told her visitor. &#8220;Went off this morning early.
He said he was going over to the Pine Ridge
Agency. But he took Jim Crow with him, and
hadn&#8217;t any idea of going until the scout came.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth ensconsed himself in an armchair and
propped his feet up on the steel bars of a huge
wood stove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said easily. &#8220;Guess there&#8217;s a deal for
him to do, come winter. With your permission I&#8217;ll
wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Parker was all cordiality. No man, in her
somewhat elderly eyes, was more welcome than
Seth. The Agent&#8217;s sister had once been heard to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
say, if there was a man to be compared with her
brother in the whole country it was Seth. She only
wondered he&#8217;d escaped being married out of hand
by one of the town girls, as she characterized the
women of Beacon Crossing. But then she was far
more prejudiced in favor of Seth than her own sex.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be glad, Seth,&#8221; she said at once; &#8220;James is
always partial to a chat with you. You just make
yourself comfortable right there. I&#8217;ve got a boil of
beef and dumplings on, which I know you like.
You&#8217;ll stay and have food?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I take that real friendly,&#8221; said Seth, smiling up
into the plain, honest face before him. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll
have a pipe and a warm while you&#8217;re fixin&#8217; things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Somehow Miss Parker found herself retiring to
her kitchen again before she had intended it.</p>
<p>During the next half hour the hostess found various
excuses for invading the parlor where Seth was
engaged in his promised occupation. She generally
had some cheery, inconsequent remark to pass.
Seth gave her little encouragement, but he was always
polite. At last the dinner was served, and,
sharp to time, Jimmy Parker returned. He came by
himself, and blustered into the warm room bringing
with him that brisk atmosphere of the outside cold
which, in winter, always makes the inside of a house
on the prairie strike one as a perfect haven of comfort.
He greeted Seth cordially as he shook the frost
from his fur-coat collar, and gently released his moustache
from its coating of ice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>Seth deferred his business until after dinner. He
never liked talking business before womenfolk.
And Miss Parker, like most of her sex in the district,
was likely to exaggerate the importance of any
chance hint about the Indians dropped in her presence.
So the boil of silverside and dumplings was
discussed to the accompaniment of a casual conversation
which was chiefly carried on by the Agent&#8217;s
sister. At length the two men found themselves
alone, and their understanding of each other was exampled
by the prompt inquiry of Parker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he questioned. Seth settled himself in
his chair and, from force of habit, spread his hands
out to the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re finishing our job with white labor,&#8221; he
said. Then as an afterthought, &#8220;Y&#8217; see we want to
git things fixed &#8217;fore spring opens.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Agent nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The beads on his moccasins had much interest for
Seth at the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never gamble a pile on Injuns&#8217; labor,&#8221; he remarked
indifferently. Parker laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It would be a dead loss&mdash;just now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth looked round inquiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wondering when you would give them up,&#8221;
the Agent went on. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a great deal of difficulty
keeping them at it. And we&#8217;re liable, I think,
to have more.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last was said very gravely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Kind o&#8217; how we&#8217;ve figgered right along?&#8221; Seth
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men relapsed into silence for a while, and
smoked on. At last Seth spoke with the air of a
man who has just finished reviewing matters of importance
in his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve taken in the well in fixin&#8217; that corral.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. We&#8217;ve got no well here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was over at Pine Ridge to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what your sister said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I went for two reasons. Jim Crow has smelt out
preparations for Sun-dances. We can&#8217;t locate where
they are going to be held, or when. I went over to
consult Jackson, and also to see how he&#8217;s getting on
over there. He&#8217;s having the same trouble getting
the Indians to look at any work. Little Black Fox
is about again. Also he sees a heap too much of
that white familiar of his, Nevil Steyne. By Jove, I
wish we could fix something on that man and get the
government to deport him. He&#8217;s got a great sway
over the chief. What the devil is his object?&#8221;
Jimmy Parker&#8217;s face flushed under his exasperation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d give a heap to git a cinch on him,&#8221; Seth replied
thoughtfully. &#8220;He&#8217;s smart. His tracks are
covered every time. Howsum, if things git doin&#8217;
this spring, I&#8217;ve a notion we&#8217;ll run him down mebbe&mdash;later.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Agent was all interest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have you discovered anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal&mdash;nothin&#8217; that counts your way. It&#8217;s jest
personal, &#8217;tween him an&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other laughed cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t be better,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;d sooner
it depended on you than on the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth let the tribute pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must locate them Sun-dances,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. We&#8217;ve got troops enough to stop them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Troops?&mdash;pshaw!&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth rose. Parker understood his last remark.
The presence of troops had long since been discussed
between them. The visitor moved toward the door,
and the Agent went to his desk. At the door Seth
turned as some thought occurred to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;d not report anything yet. Not till the
Sun-dances are located. I&#8217;ll git around some.&#8221; He
slipped into his fur coat and turned up the storm collar.</p>
<p>Parker nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep a smart eye for yourself, Seth,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Little Black Fox isn&#8217;t likely to forget. Especially
with Steyne around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Steyne &#8217;ll kind o&#8217; remember, sure.&#8221; He
passed out and left his sturdy friend wondering.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d give something to know,&#8221; that individual
said to himself, when the sound of horse&#8217;s hoofs had
died out. &#8220;Seth&#8217;s dead against Steyne, and I&#8217;d like
to bet it&#8217;s over Rosebud.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>The object of the Agent&#8217;s thoughts passed unconcernedly
on his way. He branched off the ford trail
intending to make for the bridge, below which his
men were cutting the timbers for the corral. His
way was remote from the chief encampment, and not
a single Indian showed himself.</p>
<p>The skeleton woods that lined the trail gave a
desolate air to the bleak, white prospect. The
whole of that northern world offered little promise to
the traveler, little inducement to leave the warmth
of house or tepee.</p>
<p>As the horseman neared the bridge he paused to
listen. Something of his attitude communicated
itself to his horse. The animal&#8217;s ears were laid back,
and it seemed to be listening to some sound behind
it. Whatever had attracted master and horse must
have been very faint.</p>
<p>A moment later Seth let the horse walk on and the
animal appeared content. But if the animal were so,
its master was not. He turned several times as he
approached the bridge, and scanned the crowding
branches on each side of the snow-covered trail behind
him.</p>
<p>Seth knew that he was followed. More, he knew
that the watcher was clumsy, and had not the stealth
of the Indian. At the bridge he faced about and
sat waiting. The gravity of his face was relieved by
a slight smile.</p>
<p>Suddenly the crack of a rifle rang out. The
horseman&#8217;s smile died abruptly. His horse reared,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
pawing the air, and he saw blood on the beast&#8217;s
shoulder. He saw that the flesh had been ripped by
a glancing bullet, and the course of the wound
showed him whence the shot had come.</p>
<p>He looked for the man who had fired, and, as he
did so, another shot rang out. He reeled forward in
his saddle, but straightened up almost at once, and
his right hand flew to his revolver, while he tried to
swing his horse about. But somehow he had lost
power, and the horse was in a frenzy of terror. The
next moment the beast was racing across the bridge
in the direction of home.</p>
<p>The journey was made at a great pace. Seth was
sitting bolt upright. His face was ashen, and his
eyelids drooped in spite of his best efforts.</p>
<p>Rube was in the region of the kitchen door as he
galloped up, and he called out a greeting.</p>
<p>The rider began to reply. But, at that moment,
the horse propped and halted, and the reply was
never finished. Seth rolled out of the saddle and
fell to the ground like a log.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>TWO HEADS IN CONSPIRACY</h3>
</div>

<p>Seth was badly hit; so badly that it was impossible
to say how long he might be confined to a sick-room.
His left shoulder-blade had been broken
by the bullet, which, striking under the arm, had
glanced round his ribs, and made its way dangerously
adjacent to the spine. Its path was marked
by a shocking furrow of lacerated flesh. Though
neither gave expression to the thought, both Ma and
Rube marveled at the escape he had had, and even
the doctor from Beacon Crossing, accustomed as he
was to such matters, found food for grave reflection
on the ways of Providence.</p>
<p>When the patient recovered consciousness he
maintained an impenetrable silence on the subject
of the attack made upon him. Parker and Hargreaves
protested. The military authorities demanded
explanation in vain. To all but the Agent
Seth vouchsafed the curtest of replies, and to him he
made only a slight concession.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess this is my racket,&#8221; he said, with just a
touch of invalid peevishness. &#8220;Mebbe I&#8217;ll see it
thro&#8217; my own way&mdash;later.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma and Rube refrained from question. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
theirs to help, and they knew that if there was anything
which Seth had to tell he would tell it in his
own time.</p>
<p>But time passed on, and no explanation was forthcoming.
Taking their meals together in the kitchen,
or passing quiet evenings in the parlor while their
patient slept up-stairs, Ma and Rube frequently discussed
the matter, but their speculations led them
nowhere. Still, as the sick man slowly progressed
toward recovery, they were satisfied. It was all
they asked.</p>
<p>Rube accepted the burden of the work thus thrust
upon him in cheerful silence. There was something
horse-like in his willingness for work. He just put
forth a double exertion without one single thought
of self.</p>
<p>Every week the English mail brought Ma a letter
from Rosebud, and ever since Seth had taken up his
abode in the sick-room the opening and reading of
these long, girlish epistles had become a function reserved
for his entertainment. It was a brief ray of
sunshine in the gray monotony of his long imprisonment.
On these occasions, generally Tuesdays, the
entire evening would be spent with the invalid.</p>
<p>They were happy, single-hearted little gatherings.
Ma was seated at the bedside in a great armchair before
a table on which the letter was spread out. An
additional lamp was requisitioned for the occasion,
and her glasses were polished until they shone and
gleamed in the yellow light. Seth was propped up,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
and Rube, large, silent, like a great reflective St.
Bernard dog, reclined ponderously at the foot of the
wooden bedstead. The reading proceeded with
much halting and many corrections and rereadings,
but with never an interruption from the attentive
audience.</p>
<p>The men listened to the frivolous, inconsequent
gossip of the girl, now thousands of miles away
from them, with a seriousness, a delighted happiness
that nothing else in their lives could have afforded
them. Comment came afterward, and usually from
Ma, the two men merely punctuating her remarks
with affirmative or negative monosyllables.</p>
<p>It was on the receipt of one of these letters that
Ma saw her way to a small scheme which had been
slowly revolving itself in her brain ever since Seth
was wounded. Seth had been in the habit of enclosing
occasional short notes under cover of the old
woman&#8217;s more bulky and labored replies to the girl.
Since his misadventure these, of course, had been
discontinued, with the result that now, at last, Rosebud
was asking for an explanation.</p>
<p>In reading the letter aloud Ma avoided that portion
of it which referred to the matter. Her reason
was obviously to keep her own plans from her boy&#8217;s
knowledge, but so clumsily did she skip to another
part of the letter, that, all unconscious of it, she drew
from her audience a sharp look of inquiry.</p>
<p>Nothing was said at the time, but the following
day, at supper, when Ma and Rube were alone,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
the man, who had taken the whole day to consider
the matter, spoke of it in the blunt fashion habitual
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess ther&#8217; was suthin&#8217; in that letter you didn&#8217;t
read, Ma?&#8221; he said without preamble.</p>
<p>Ma looked up. Her bright eyes peered keenly
through her spectacles into her husband&#8217;s massive
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; if ther&#8217; was?&#8221; she said interrogatively.</p>
<p>The old man shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I was wonderin&#8217;,&#8221; he said, plying his
knife and fork with some show of indifference.</p>
<p>A silence followed. Ma helped herself to more
tea and refilled her husband&#8217;s mug.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess we&#8217;ll have to tell the child,&#8221; she said
presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems like.&#8221;</p>
<p>A longer silence followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was jest askin&#8217; why Seth didn&#8217;t write.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I kind o&#8217; figgered suthin&#8217; o&#8217; that natur&#8217;. You&#8217;d
best tell her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rube rested the ends of his knife and fork on the
extremities of his plate and took a noisy draught
from his huge mug of tea. A quiet smile lurked in
the old woman&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rosebud&#8217;s mighty impulsive,&#8221; she observed
slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ef you mean she kind o&#8217; jumps at things, I take
it that&#8217;s how.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old woman nodded, and a reflection of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
smile twinkled in her husband&#8217;s eyes as he gazed
over at the little figure opposite him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; said Rube, expansively, &#8220;it ain&#8217;t fer me
to tell you, Ma, but we&#8217;ve got our dooty. Guess I
ain&#8217;t a heap at writin&#8217; fancy notions, but mebbe I
ken help some. Y&#8217; see it&#8217;s you an&#8217; me. I &#8217;lows
Seth would hate to worrit Rosie wi&#8217; things, but as I
said we&#8217;ve got our dooty, an&#8217; it seems&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dooty?&#8221; Ma chuckled. &#8220;Say, Rube, we&#8217;ll
write to the girl, you an&#8217; me. An&#8217; we don&#8217;t need to
ask no by-your-leave of nobody. Not even Seth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even Seth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two conspirators eyed one another slyly,
smiled with a quaint knowingness, and resumed
their supper in silence.</p>
<p>A common thought, a common hope, held them.
Neither would have spoken it openly, even though
no one was there to overhear. Each felt that they
were somehow taking advantage of Seth and, perhaps,
not doing quite the right thing by Rosebud;
but after all they were old, simple people who loved
these two, and had never quite given up the hope of
seeing them ultimately brought together.</p>
<p>The meal was finished, and half an hour later they
were further working out their mild conspiracy in
the parlor. Ma was the scribe, and was seated at
the table surrounded by all the appurtenances of her
business. Rube, in a great mental effort, was clouding
the atmosphere with the reeking fumes of his
pipe. The letter was a delicate matter, and its responsibility
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
sat heavily on this man of the plains.
Ma was less embarrassed; her woman&#8217;s instinct
helped her. Besides, since Rosebud had been away
she had almost become used to writing letters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Rube,&#8221; she said, looking up after heading
her note-paper, &#8220;how d&#8217; you think it&#8217;ll fix her when
she hears?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rube gazed at the twinkling eyes raised to his;
he gave a chuckling grunt, and his words came with
elephantine meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be all of a muss-up at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma&#8217;s smile broadened.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s makin&#8217; you laff, Ma?&#8221; the old man
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest nuthin&#8217;. I was figgerin&#8217; if the gal could&mdash;if
we could git her reply before spring opens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems likely&mdash;if the boat don&#8217;t sink.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma put the end of her pen in her mouth and eyed
her man. Rube scratched his head and smoked
hard. Neither spoke. At last the woman jerked
out an impatient inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Rube removed his pipe from his lips with great
deliberation and eased himself in his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve located the name of the farm on top, an&#8217;
the State, an&#8217; the date?&#8221; he inquired, by way of
gaining time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I ain&#8217;t daft, Rube.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; The man spoke as though his answer were
the result of deliberate thought. Then he cleared his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
throat, took a long final pull at his pipe, removed it
from his mouth, held it poised in the manner of one
who has something of importance to say, and sat
bolt upright. &#8220;Then I guess we ken git right on.&#8221;
And having thus clearly marked their course he sat
back and complacently surveyed his wife.</p>
<p>But the brilliancy of his suggestion was lost on
Ma, and she urged him further.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal&mdash;I&#8217;d jest say, &#8216;Honored Lady,&#8217;&#8221; he suggested
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mussy on the man, we&#8217;re writin&#8217; to Rosebud!&#8221;
exclaimed the old woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221; Rube nodded patronizingly, but he
seemed a little uncomfortable under his wife&#8217;s stare
of amazement. &#8220;But,&#8221; he added, in a tone meant
to clinch the argument, &#8220;she ain&#8217;t &#8217;Rosebud&#8217; no
longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rubbish an&#8217; stuff! She&#8217;s &#8216;Rosebud&#8217;&mdash;jest
&#8217;Rosebud.&#8217; An&#8217; &#8217;dearest Rosebud&#8217; at that, an&#8217; so
I&#8217;ve got it,&#8221; Ma said, hurriedly writing the words as
she spoke. &#8220;Now,&#8221; she went on, looking up, &#8220;you
can git on wi&#8217; the notions to foller.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Rube cleared his throat. Ma watched him,
chewing the end of her penholder the while. The
man knocked his pipe out and slowly began to refill
it. He looked out the window into the blackness of
the winter night. His vast face was heavy with
thought, and his shaggy gray brows were closely
knit. As she watched, the old woman&#8217;s bright eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
smiled. Her thoughts had gone back to their courting
days. She thought of the two or three letters
Rube had contrived to send her, which were still up-stairs
in an old trunk containing her few treasures.
She remembered that these letters had, in each case,
begun with &#8220;Honored Lady.&#8221; She wondered where
he had obtained the notion which still remained with
him after all these years.</p>
<p>Feeling the silence becoming irksome Rube moved
uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Y&#8217; see it&#8217;s kind o&#8217; del&#8217;cate. Don&#8217;t need handlin&#8217;
rough,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Seems you&#8217;d best go on like
this. Mebbe you ken jest pop it down rough-like
an&#8217; fix it after. &#8216;Which it&#8217;s my painful dooty an&#8217;
pleasure&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;La, but you always was neat at fixin&#8217; words,
Rube,&#8221; Ma murmured, while she proceeded to write.
&#8220;How&#8217;s this?&#8221; she went on presently, reading what
she had just written. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to have to tell you
as Seth&#8217;s got hurt pretty bad. He&#8217;s mighty sick,
an&#8217; liable to be abed come spring. Pore feller, he&#8217;s
patient as he always is, but he&#8217;s all mussed-up an&#8217;
broken shocking; shot in the side an&#8217; got bones
smashed up. Howsum, he&#8217;s goin&#8217; on all right, an&#8217;
we hope for the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;lows that&#8217;s neat,&#8221; Rube said, lighting his
pipe. &#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t jest what I&#8217;d fancy. Sounds kind
o&#8217; familiar. An&#8217; I guess it&#8217;s li&#8217;ble to scare her
some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I tho&#8217;t we&#8217;d put it easy-like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma looked a little scornful. Rube was certainly
lacking in duplicity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Rube, you ain&#8217;t a bit smarter than when
you courted me. I jest want that gal to think it&#8217;s
mighty bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; Rube stared.</p>
<p>Ma was getting impatient.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you never could see a mile from your
own nose, Rube; you&#8217;re that dull an&#8217; slow wher&#8217;
gals is concerned. I&#8217;ll write this letter in my own
way. You&#8217;d best go an&#8217; yarn with Seth. An&#8217; you
needn&#8217;t say nuthin&#8217; o&#8217; this to him. We&#8217;ll git a
quick answer from Rosebud, or I&#8217;m ter&#8217;ble slow
&#8217;bout some things, like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cloud of responsibility suddenly lifted from
the farmer&#8217;s heavy features. He smiled his relief at
his partner in conspiracy. He knew that in such a
matter as the letter he was as much out of place as
one of his own steers would be. Ma, he was convinced,
was one of the cleverest of her sex, and if
Seth and Rosebud were ever to be brought together
again she would do it. So he rose, and, moving
round to the back of his wife&#8217;s chair, laid his great
hand tenderly on her soft, gray hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;You git right to it, Ma,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We ain&#8217;t got
no chick of our own. Ther&#8217;s jest Seth to foller us,
an&#8217; if you ken help him out in this thing, same as
you once helped me out, you&#8217;re doin&#8217; a real fine
thing. The boy ain&#8217;t happy wi&#8217;out Rosebud, an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
ain&#8217;t never like to be. You fix it, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll buy you a
noo buggy. Guess I&#8217;ll go to Seth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma looked up at the gigantic man, and the tender
look she gave him belied the practical brusqueness
of her words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you git talkin&#8217; foolish. Ther&#8217; was a time
when I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; liked you to talk foolish, but you
couldn&#8217;t do it then, you were that slow. Git right
along. I&#8217;ll fix this letter, an&#8217; read it to you when
it&#8217;s done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rube passed out of the room, gurgling a deep-throated
chuckle, while his wife went steadily on
with the all-important matter in hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>ROSEBUD&#8217;S ANSWER</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a dazzling morning nearly five weeks after
the dispatching of Ma Sampson&#8217;s letter to Rosebud.
The heralds of spring, the warm, southern breezes,
which brought trailing flights of geese and wild duck
winging northward, and turned the pallor of the
snow to a dirty drab hue, like a soiled white dress,
had already swept across the plains. The sunlight
was fiercely blinding. Even the plainsman is wary
at this time of the year, for the perils of snow-blindness
are as real to him as to the &#8220;tenderfoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>There had been no reply from Rosebud. Two
more letters from her reached the farm, but they had
been written before the letter, which Rube helped to
compose, had been received. Since then no word
had come from the girl. Ma was satisfied, and accepted
her silence with equanimity, but for appearances&#8217;
sake assumed an attitude of complaint. Rube
said nothing; he had no subtlety in these matters.
Seth was quite in the dark. He never complained,
but he was distressed at this sudden and unaccountable
desertion.</p>
<p>Seth&#8217;s wound and broken shoulder had healed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
He had been up a week, but this was his first day
out of the house. Now he stood staring out with
shaded eyes in the direction of the Reservations.
During the past week he had received visits from
many of the neighboring settlers. Parker, particularly,
had been his frequent companion. He had
learned all that it was possible for him to learn by
hearsay of the things which most interested him;
but, even so, he felt that he had much time to make
up, much to learn that could come only from his own
observation.</p>
<p>Now, on this his first day out in the open, he found
himself feeling very weak, a thin, pale shadow of his
former self. Curiously enough he had little inclination
for anything. He simply stood gazing upon the
scene before him, drinking in deep draughts of the
pure, bracing, spring air. Though his thoughts
should have been with those matters which concerned
the welfare of the homestead, they were thousands
of miles away, somewhere in a London of his
own imagination, among people he had never seen,
looking on at a life and pleasures of which he had no
knowledge of, and through it all he was struggling
to understand how it was Rosebud had come to forget
them all so utterly, and so suddenly.</p>
<p>He tried to make allowances, to point out to himself
the obligations of the girl&#8217;s new life. He excused
her at every point; yet, when it was all done, when
he had proved to himself the utter impossibility of
her keeping up a weekly correspondence, he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
dissatisfied, disappointed. There was something behind
it all, some reason which he could not fathom.</p>
<p>In the midst of these reflections he was joined by
Rube. The old man was smoking his after-breakfast
pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s openin&#8217;,&#8221; he said, indicating the brown
patches of earth already showing through the snow.
Seth nodded.</p>
<p>They were standing just outside the great stockade
which had been completed during Seth&#8217;s long
illness. There were only the gates waiting to be
hung upon their vast iron hinges.</p>
<p>After the old man&#8217;s opening remark a long silence
fell. Seth&#8217;s thoughts ran on unchecked in spite of
the other&#8217;s presence. Rube smoked and watched the
lean figure beside him out of the corners of his eyes.
He was speculating, too, but his thought was of their
own immediate surroundings. Now that Seth was
about again he felt that it would be good to talk
with him. He knew there was much to consider.
Though perhaps he lacked something of the younger
man&#8217;s keen Indian knowledge he lacked nothing in
experience, and experience told him that the winter,
after what had gone before, had been, but for the one
significant incident of Seth&#8217;s wound, very, very quiet&mdash;too
quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, boy,&#8221; the old man went on, some minutes
later, &#8220;guess you ain&#8217;t yarned a heap &#8217;bout your
shootin&#8217; racket?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth was suddenly brought back to his surroundings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
His eyes thoughtfully settled on the distant
line of woodland that marked the river and the Reservation.
He answered readily enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;That shootin&#8217; don&#8217;t affect nothin&#8217;&mdash;nothin&#8217; but
me,&#8221; he said with meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Little&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth shook his head. He took Rube&#8217;s meaning at
once.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s to come, I guess,&#8221; he said gravely.</p>
<p>Rube suddenly looked away down the trail in the
direction of Beacon Crossing. His quick ears had
caught an unusual sound. It was a &#8220;Coo-ee,&#8221; but
so thin and faint that it came to him like the cry of
some small bird. Seth heard it, too, and he turned
and gazed over the rotting sleigh track which spring
was fast rendering impassable. There was nothing
in sight. Just the gray expanse of melting snow,
dismal, uninteresting even in the flooding sunlight.</p>
<p>Rube turned back to the gateway of the stockade.
His pipe was finished and he had work to do. Seth
was evidently in no mood for talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d git around and breathe good air fer awhiles,&#8221;
he said kindly, &#8220;y&#8217; ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to git strong of a sudden,
Seth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll ride this afternoon. Hello!&#8221;</p>
<p>The cry reached them again, louder, still high-pitched
and shrill, but nearer. Away down the trail
a figure in black furs was moving toward them.</p>
<p>Both men watched the object with the keenest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
interest. It was a mere speck on the gray horizon,
but it was plainly human, and evidently wishful to
draw their attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some&#8217;un wantin&#8217; us?&#8221; said Rube in a puzzled
tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems.&#8221; Seth was intent upon the figure.</p>
<p>Another &#8220;Coo-ee&#8221; rang out, and Rube responded
with his deep guttural voice. And, in answer, the
bundle of furs raised two arms and waved them
beckoningly.</p>
<p>Rube moved along the trail. Without knowing
quite why, but roused to a certain curiosity, he was
going to meet the newcomer. Seth followed him.</p>
<p>Seth&#8217;s gait was slower than the older man&#8217;s, and
he soon dropped behind. Suddenly he saw Rube
stop and turn, beckoning him on. When he came
up the old man pointed down the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a woman,&#8221; he said, and there was a curious
look in his eyes.</p>
<p>The muffled figure was more than a hundred and
fifty yards away, but still laboriously stumbling along
the snow-bound trail toward them.</p>
<p>Before Seth could find a reply another &#8220;Coo-ee&#8221;
reached them, followed quickly by some words that
were blurred by the distance. Seth started. The
voice had a curiously familiar sound. He glanced
at Rube, and the old man&#8217;s face wore a look of
grinning incredulity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Seth began to speak but
broke off.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! Come on!&#8221; cried Rube, in a boisterous
tone. &#8220;It&#8217;s Rosebud!&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men hastened forward. Rube&#8217;s announcement
seemed incredible. How could it be Rosebud&mdash;and
on foot? The surface of the trail gave way under
their feet at almost every step. But they were undeterred.
Slush or ice, deep snow or floundering in
water holes, it made no difference. It was a race for
that muffled figure, and Rube was an easy winner.
When Seth came up he found the bundle of furs in
the bear-like embrace of the older man. It was
Rosebud!</p>
<p>Questions raced through Seth&#8217;s brain as he looked
on, panting with the exertion his enfeebled frame had
been put to. How? Why? What was the meaning
of it all? But his questions remained unspoken.
Nor was he left in doubt long. Rosebud laughing,
her wonderful eyes dancing with an inexpressible
delight, released herself and turned to Seth. Immediately
her face fell as she looked on the shadow
of a man standing before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Seth,&#8221; she cried, in a tone of great pity
and alarm that deceived even Rube, &#8220;what&#8217;s the
matter that you look so ill?&#8221; She turned swiftly
and flashed a meaning look into Rube&#8217;s eyes.
&#8220;What is it? Quick! Oh, you two sillies, tell me!
Seth, you&#8217;ve been ill, and you never told me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Slow of wit, utterly devoid of subterfuge as Rube
was, for once he grasped the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, gal, it&#8217;s jest nothin&#8217;. Seth&#8217;s been mighty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
sick, but he&#8217;s right enough now, ain&#8217;t you, Seth,
boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth had nothing to add, but he held out his hand,
and the girl seized it in both of hers, while her eyes
darkened to an expression which these men failed to
interpret, but which Ma Sampson could have read
aright. Seth cleared his throat, and his dark eyes
gazed beyond the girl and down the trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you come, Rosie?&#8221; he asked practically.
&#8220;You ain&#8217;t traipsed from Beacon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly the girl&#8217;s laugh rang out. It was the old
irresponsible laugh that had always been the joy of
these men&#8217;s hearts, and it brought a responsive smile
to their faces now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I forgot,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;The delight of seeing
you two dears put it out of my silly head. Why, we
drove out from Beacon, and the wagon&#8217;s stuck in a
hollow away back, and my cousin, I call her &#8217;aunt,&#8217;
and her maid, and all the luggage are mired on the
road, calling down I don&#8217;t know what terrible curses
upon the country and its people, and our teamster in
particular. So I just left them to it and came right
on to get help. Auntie was horrified at my going,
you know. Said I&#8217;d get rheumatic fever and pneumonia,
and threatened to take me back home if I
went, and I told her she couldn&#8217;t unless I got help to
move the wagon, and so here I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rube&#8217;s great face had never ceased to beam, and
now, as the girl paused for breath, he turned for home.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll jest get the team out. Gee!&#8221; And
he went off at a great gait.</p>
<p>Seth looked gravely at the girl&#8217;s laughing face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;d best come on home. Mebbe your
feet <i>are</i> wet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus, after months of parting, despite the changed
conditions of the girl&#8217;s life, the old order was resumed.
Rosebud accepted Seth&#8217;s domination as though it
was his perfect right. Without one word or thought
of protest she walked at his side. In silence he
helped her over the broken trail to the home she had
so long known and still claimed. Once only was that
silence broken. It was when the girl beheld the
fortified appearance of the farm. She put her question
in a low, slightly awed tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this for, Seth?&#8221; she asked. She knew,
but she felt that she must ask.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them logs?&#8221; The man responded indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that stockade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, jest nothin&#8217;. Y&#8217; see we need a bit o&#8217; fence-like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud looked at him from out of the corners of
her eyes as she trudged at his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I came, Seth. I&#8217;m just in time. Poor
auntie!&#8221;</p>
<p>The next moment her arms were around Ma
Sampson&#8217;s neck, hugging the old woman, who had
heard of the girl&#8217;s arrival from Rube and had come
out to meet her.</p>
<p>&#8220;La sakes, come right in at once, Rosie, gal!&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
exclaimed, when she was permitted a chance of
speech. And laughing and chattering in the very
wildest delight, Rosebud led the way and romped
into the house.</p>
<p>In the dear familiar kitchen, after the girl had
gazed at the various simple furnishings she had so
long known and loved, she poured out her tale, the
reason of her coming, with a blissful disregard for
truth. Ma took her cue and listened to the wonderful
fabrication the girl piled up for her astonished
ears, and more particularly Seth&#8217;s. Apparently the
one thing that had not entered into her madcap considerations
was Seth&#8217;s illness.</p>
<p>Just as her story came to an end, and the sound of
wheels outside warned them of the arrival of the
wagon, Rosebud turned upon Seth with something of
her old wilful impetuosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, Seth,&#8221; she said, her eyes dancing with
audacity and mischief, &#8220;you&#8217;re a sick man and all
that, so there&#8217;s every excuse for you, but you haven&#8217;t
said you&#8217;re glad to see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth smiled thoughtfully as he gazed on the fair,
trim-figured woman challenging him. He noted
with a man&#8217;s pleasure the perfectly fitting tailor-made
traveling costume, the beautifully arranged hair, the
delightful Parisian hat. He looked into the animated
face, the only thing about her that seemed to be as
of old. Though he saw that her outward appearance
was changed, even improved, he knew that that was
all. It was the same Rosebud, the same old spirit,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
honest, fearless, warm-hearted, loving, that looked
out of her wondrous eyes, and he felt his pulses stir
and something like a lump rose in his throat as he
answered her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, little gal, I guess you don&#8217;t need me to tell
you. Pleased! that don&#8217;t cut no meanin&#8217;. Yet I&#8217;m
kind o&#8217; sorry too. Y&#8217; see ther&#8217;s things&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma interrupted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s right, Rosebud dear, it&#8217;s a bad time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s reply came with a laugh full of careless
mischief and confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor auntie!&#8221; Then she became suddenly serious.
&#8220;They&#8217;re outside,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Let us
go and bring her in.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment later Ma found herself greeting Rosebud&#8217;s
second cousin and chaperone. Mrs. Rickards
was an elderly lady, stout, florid, and fashionably
dressed, who had never been further afield in her life
than the Europe of society.</p>
<p>Her greeting was an effort. She was struggling
to conceal a natural anger and resentment against
the inconvenience of their journey from Beacon
Crossing, and the final undignified catastrophe of the
wagon sticking fast in the slush and mud on the trail,
and against Rosebud in particular, under a polite attempt
at cordiality. She would probably have
succeeded in recovering her natural good-humored
composure but for the girl herself, who, in the
midst of the good creature&#8217;s expostulations, put
the final touch to her mischief. Mrs. Rickards had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
turned solicitously upon her charge with an admonitory
finger raised in her direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;And as for Rosie,&mdash;she insists on being called
Rosebud still, Mrs. Sampson&mdash;after her tramp through
all that dreadful snow and slush she must be utterly
done up,&#8221; she said kindly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Done up, auntie? Tired?&#8221; the girl said, with a
little scornful laugh. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe it. Why
the fun&#8217;s only just beginning, isn&#8217;t it, Seth? Do you
know, auntie dear, the Indians are getting troublesome;
they&#8217;re going out on the war-path. Aren&#8217;t
they, Seth? And we&#8217;re just in time to get scalped.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Seth had no responsive smile for the girl&#8217;s
sally. His face was grave enough as he turned to
the horrified woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said, in that slow drawling fashion
which gave so much gravity and dignity to his
speech, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take it kindly if you won&#8217;t gamble a
heap on this little gal&#8217;s nonsense. I&#8217;ve known her
some few years, an&#8217; I guess she&#8217;s nigh the worst savage
in these parts&mdash;which, I guess, says a deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth&#8217;s rebuke lost nothing of its sharpness by reason
of the gentle manner in which it was spoken.
Rosebud felt its full force keenly. She flushed to the
roots of her hair and her eyes were bright with resentment.
She pouted her displeasure and, without
a word, abruptly left the room.</p>
<p>Ma and Mrs. Rickards&mdash;the latter&#8217;s composure
quite restored by Seth&#8217;s reassurance&mdash;looked after
her. Both smiled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>Seth remained grave. The girl&#8217;s mischief had
brought home to him the full responsibility which
devolved upon Rube and himself.</p>
<p>Truly it was the old Rosebud who had returned to
White River Farm.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>LOVE&#8217;S PROGRESS</h3>
</div>

<p>It was the night of Rosebud&#8217;s arrival. Seth and
Rube were just leaving the barn. The long day&#8217;s
work was done. Seth had been out all the afternoon
riding. Although his ride was nominally in pursuit
of health and strength, he had by no means been
idle. Now he was bodily weary, and at the door of
the barn he sat down on the corn-bin. Rube, pausing
to prepare his pipe, saw, by the flickering light
of the stable lantern, that his companion&#8217;s face was
ghastly pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feelin&#8217; kind o&#8217; mean?&#8221; he suggested with gruff
sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaner&#8217;n a yaller dawg.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was anxiety in the older man&#8217;s deep-set eyes
as he noted the flicker of a smile which accompanied
the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; fresh?&#8221; Rube pursued, as the
other remained silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, no, &#8217;cep&#8217; Rosebud&#8217;s got back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess it means a heap,&#8221; he said, and paused.
Then a faint flush slowly spread over his thin, drawn
face. &#8220;Nothin&#8217; could &#8217;a&#8217; happened along now wuss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
than Rosie&#8217;s gettin&#8217; around,&#8221; he went on with intense
feeling. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you see, Rube?&#8221; He reached out
and laid an emphatic hand on his companion&#8217;s arm.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see what&#8217;s goin&#8217; to come? Ther&#8217;s trouble
comin&#8217; sure. Trouble for us all. Trouble for
that gal. The news is around the Reservation now.
It&#8217;ll reach Black Fox &#8217;fore to-morrow mornin&#8217;, an&#8217;
then&mdash;&mdash;Pshaw! Rube, I love that gal. She&#8217;s more
to me than even you an&#8217; Ma; she&#8217;s more to me than
life. I can&#8217;t never marry her, seein&#8217; how things are,
but that don&#8217;t cut no figger. But I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to see
after her whatever happens. Ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no help
comin&#8217;. Them few soldier-fellers don&#8217;t amount to a
heap o&#8217; beans. The Injuns &#8217;ll chaw &#8217;em up if they
notion it. An&#8217; I&#8217;m like a dead man, Rube&mdash;jest a
hulk. God, Rube, if harm comes to that pore
gal&mdash;&mdash;Pshaw!&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth&#8217;s outburst was so unusual that Rube stared in
silent amazement. It seemed as if his bodily weakness
had utterly broken down the stern self-repression
usually his. It was as though with the weakening
of muscle had come a collapse of his wonderful self-reliance,
and against his will he was driven to seek
support.</p>
<p>Rube removed his pipe from his mouth. His slow
moving brain was hard at work. His sympathy was
not easy for him to express.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess it ain&#8217;t easy, Seth, boy,&#8221; he said judicially,
at last. &#8220;Them things never come easy if a man&#8217;s
a man. I&#8217;ve felt the same in the old days, &#8217;fore Ma
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
an&#8217; me got hitched. Y&#8217; see the Injuns wus wuss
them days&mdash;a sight. Guess I jest sat tight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though so gently spoken, the old man&#8217;s words
had instant effect. Already Seth was ashamed of his
weakness. He knew, no one better, the strenuous
life of single-hearted courage this old man had
lived.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m kind o&#8217; sorry I spoke, Rube. But I ain&#8217;t jest
thinkin&#8217; o&#8217; myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, boy. You&#8217;re jest worritin&#8217; &#8217;cause you&#8217;re
sick. I know you. You an&#8217; me are goin&#8217; to set
tight. Your eye &#8217;ll be on the gal; guess I&#8217;ll figger
on Ma. These sort o&#8217; troubles jest come and go.
I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em before. So&#8217;ve you. It&#8217;s the gal that
makes the diff&#8217;rence fer you. Say, lad,&#8221; Rube laid a
kindly hand on the sick man&#8217;s drooping shoulders,
and his manner became lighter, and there was a
twinkle in his deep-set eyes, &#8220;when I&#8217;d located that
I wanted Ma fer wife I jest up an&#8217; sez so. I &#8217;lows
the job wa&#8217;n&#8217;t easy. I&#8217;d a heap sooner &#8217;a&#8217; let daylight
into the carkises of a dozen Injuns. Y&#8217; see
wimmin&#8217;s li&#8217;ble to fool you some. When they knows
you&#8217;re fixed on &#8217;em they jest makes you hate yourself
fer a foolhead. It&#8217;s in the natur&#8217; of &#8217;em. They&#8217;re
most like young fillies &#8217;fore they&#8217;re broke&mdash;I sez it
wi&#8217;out disrespec&#8217;. Y&#8217; see a wummin ain&#8217;t got a
roarin&#8217; time of it in this world. An&#8217; jest about when
a man gets fixed on &#8217;em is their real fancy time, an&#8217;
they ain&#8217;t slow to take all ther&#8217; is comin&#8217;. An&#8217; I sez
they&#8217;re dead right. An&#8217; jest when you&#8217;re bustin&#8217; to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
tell &#8217;em how you&#8217;re feelin&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; ain&#8217;t got the savee&mdash;they&#8217;re
jest bustin&#8217; to hear that same. An&#8217; that&#8217;s
how I got figgerin&#8217; after awhiles, an&#8217; so I ups an&#8217; has
it out squar&#8217;. Y&#8217; see,&#8221; he finished, with an air of
pride which brought a smile to Seth&#8217;s face, &#8220;I kind
o&#8217; swep&#8217; Ma off her feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The younger man had no reply to make. His
mind went back to Ma&#8217;s version of Rube&#8217;s courtship.
Rube, thoroughly enjoying his task of rousing the
other&#8217;s drooping spirits, went on, carried away by
his own enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, why has Rosie come back, boy, I&#8217;d like to
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She said as she couldn&#8217;t endure a city no longer.
She wanted the plains, the Injuns, Ma, you, an&#8217; the
farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw&mdash;boy! Plains! Farm! Injuns! Ha,
ha! Say, Seth, you ain&#8217;t smart, not wuth a cent.
She come back &#8217;cos she&#8217;s jest bustin&#8217; to hear what
you darsen&#8217;t tell her. She&#8217;s come back &#8217;cos she&#8217;s a
wummin, an&#8217; couldn&#8217;t stay away when you wus sick
an&#8217; wounded to death. I know. I ain&#8217;t bin married
fer five an&#8217; twenty year an&#8217; more wi&#8217;out gittin&#8217; to the
bottom o&#8217; female natur&#8217;&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she didn&#8217;t know I was sick, Rube.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rube stood aghast at what he had said. Seth&#8217;s
remark had, in his own way of thinking, &#8220;struck
him all of a heap.&#8221; He realized in a flash where his
blundering had led him. He had run past himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
in his enthusiasm, and given Ma&#8217;s little scheme
away, and, for the moment, the enormity of his offence
robbed him of the power of speech. However,
he pulled himself together with an effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I wus chawin&#8217; more&#8217;n I could swaller,&#8221; he
said ruefully. &#8220;Ma allus did say my head wus
mostly mutton, an&#8217; I kind o&#8217; figger she has a power
o&#8217; wisdom. An&#8217; it wus a dead secret&mdash;&#8217;tween her
an&#8217; me. Say, Seth, boy, you won&#8217;t give me away?
Y&#8217; see Ma&#8217;s mighty easy, but she&#8217;s got a way wi&#8217;
her, Ma has.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man&#8217;s distress was painfully comical.
The perspiration stood out on his rugged forehead
in large beads, and his kindly eyes were full of a
great trouble. Seth&#8217;s next remark came in the form
of an uncompromising question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Ma wrote an&#8217; told her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, if it comes to that I guess she must
have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth rose wearily from his seat, and ranged his
lean figure beside the old man&#8217;s bulk. &#8220;All right,
dad,&#8221; he said, in his quiet, sober way. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad
you&#8217;ve told me. But it don&#8217;t alter nothin&#8217;, I guess.
Meanwhile I&#8217;ll git round, an&#8217; quit whinin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The arrival of Rosebud&#8217;s cousin and her maid
somewhat disorganized the Sampsons&#8217; simple household.
Rosebud&#8217;s love of mischief was traceable in
this incongruous descent upon the farm. Her own
coming was a matter which no obstacle would have
stayed. Ma&#8217;s letter had nearly broken her heart,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
and her anxiety was absolutely pitiable until the
actual start had been made.</p>
<p>That Seth was ill&mdash;wounded&mdash;and she had not
known from the first, had distracted her, and her
mind was made up before she had finished reading
the letter. Her obligations to her new life were set
aside without a second thought. What if there were
invitations to social functions accepted? What if
her cousin&#8217;s household were thrown into confusion
by her going? These things were nothing to her;
Seth might be dying, and her heart ached, and
something very like terror urged her to hasten.</p>
<p>She had long since learned that Seth, and Seth
alone, was all her world. Then the old mischievous
leaning possessed her, and she resolved, willy-nilly,
that Mrs. Rickards, whose love she had long since
won, as she won everybody&#8217;s with whom she came
into contact, should accompany her.</p>
<p>This old lady, used only to the very acme of comfort,
had welcomed the idea of visiting Rosebud&#8217;s
home in the wilds. Moreover, until the final stage
of the journey, she thoroughly enjoyed herself. It
was not until traveling from Beacon Crossing, and
the camping out at the half-way house, that the
roughness of the country was brought home to her.
Then came the final miring of the wagon, and she
reviled the whole proceeding.</p>
<p>But the ultimate arrival at the farm, and the meeting
with its homely folk, soon restored her equanimity.
She at once warmed to Ma, whose gentle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
practical disposition displayed such a wealth of true
womanliness as to be quite irresistible, and, in the
confidence of her bedchamber, which she shared with
Rosebud, she imparted her favorable impressions.
She assured the girl she no longer wondered that
she, Rosebud, with everything that money could
purchase, still longed to return to the shelter of the
love which these rough frontier-folk so surely lavished
upon her.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear,&#8221; she added, as a warning proviso,
and with a touch of worldliness which her own life
in England had made almost part of her nature,
&#8220;though Mrs. Sampson is so deliciously simple and
good, and Mr. Sampson is such an exquisite rough
diamond, this Seth, whose trouble has brought us
out here, with such undignified haste, is not the man
to make the fuss about that you have been doing all
the journey. He&#8217;s a fine man, or will be when he
recovers from his illness, I have no doubt; but, after
all, I feel it my duty by your dead father to warn
you that I think you are much too concerned about
him for a girl in your position.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth do you mean, auntie?&#8221; Rosebud
exclaimed, pausing in the process of brushing out
her obstinately curling hair. &#8220;What position have
I but that which these dear people have helped me
to&mdash;that Seth, himself, has made for me? I owe all
I have, or am at this moment, to Seth. He saved
me from a fate too terrible to contemplate. He has
saved my life, not once, but half a dozen times; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
found me my father&#8217;s fortune, or the fortune which
father has left for me when I marry. You are more
unkind than ever I thought you could be. You
wait, auntie, you may yet learn to&mdash;to appreciate
Seth as I do. You see I know&mdash;you don&#8217;t. You&#8217;re
good, and wise, and all that; but you don&#8217;t know&mdash;Seth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s very evident that you think you do,
dear,&#8221; Mrs. Rickards said, wearily rolling over and
snuggling down amidst the snowy sheets of the soft
feather-bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no question of thinking,&#8221; Rosebud
smiled mischievously into the looking-glass in the
direction of her relative. &#8220;And if Seth were to ask
me I would marry him to-morrow&mdash;there. Yes, and
I&#8217;d make him get a special license to avoid unnecessary
delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of a sudden Mrs. Rickards started up in bed. For
one moment she severely eyed the girl&#8217;s laughing
face. Then her anger died out, and she dropped
back on the pillow.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the moment I thought you meant it,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so I do,&#8221; was the girl&#8217;s swift retort. &#8220;But
there,&#8221; as a horrified exclamation came from the bed,
&#8220;he won&#8217;t ask me, auntie,&#8221; the girl went on, with a
dash of angry impatience in her voice, &#8220;so you
needn&#8217;t worry. Seth has a sense of honor which I
call quixotic, and one that might reasonably shame
the impecunious fortune-hunters I&#8217;ve met since I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
lived in England. No, I&#8217;m afraid if I were to marry
Seth it wouldn&#8217;t be his doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This Seth said you were a savage&mdash;and he&#8217;s
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this parting shot Mrs. Rickards turned over,
and, a moment later, was comfortably asleep, as her
heavy breathing indicated. Rosebud remained a
long time at the dressing-table, but her hair didn&#8217;t
trouble her. Her head was bowed on her arms, and
she was quietly weeping. Nor could she have explained
her tears. They were the result of a blending
of both joy and sorrow. Joy at returning to the
farm and at finding Seth on the highroad to recovery;
and sorrow&mdash;who shall attempt to probe the depths
of this maiden&#8217;s heart?</p>
<p>The day following Rosebud&#8217;s return was a momentous
one. True to her impulsive character the
girl, unknown to anybody, saddled her own mare and
rode off on a visit to Wanaha. Seth was away from
the farm, or he would probably have stopped her.
Rube knew nothing of her going, and Ma had her
time too much occupied with Mrs. Rickards and her
maid to attend to anything but her household duties.
So Rosebud was left to her own devices, which, as
might have been expected, led her to do the one
thing least desirable.</p>
<p>Wanaha was overjoyed at the girl&#8217;s return. The
good Indian woman had experienced a very real
sense of loss, when, without even a farewell, Rosebud
suddenly departed from their midst. Added to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
this Wanaha had had a pretty bad time with her
husband after the affair in the river woods. Abnormally
shrewd where all others were concerned, she was
utterly blind in her husband&#8217;s favor. His temper
suddenly soured with Rosebud&#8217;s going, and the loyal
wife suffered in consequence. Yet she failed to appreciate
the significance of the change.</p>
<p>There was no suspicion in her mind of the manner
in which she had foiled his plans, or even of the nature
of them. The attempt to kidnap the white girl
she put down to the enterprise of her brother&#8217;s fierce,
lawless nature, and as having nothing whatever to do
with her husband. In fact she still believed it was of
that very danger which Nevil had wanted to warn
Rosebud.</p>
<p>Now, when the girl suddenly burst in upon her,
Wanaha was overjoyed, for she thought she had
surely left the prairie world forever. They spent the
best part of the morning together. Then Nevil
came in for his dinner. When he beheld the girl,
fair and deliciously fresh in her old prairie habit, sitting
on the bed in the hut, a wave of devilish joy
swept over him. He already knew that she had returned
to the farm&mdash;how, it would have been impossible
to say&mdash;but that she should still come to his
shack seemed incredible.</p>
<p>Evidently Seth had held his tongue. Though he
wondered a little uneasily at the reason, he was quick
to see his advantage and the possibilities opening before
him. He had passed from the stage when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
was content to avail himself of chance opportunities.
Now he would seek them&mdash;he would make opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you have come back to us again,&#8221; he
said, after greeting the girl, while Wanaha smiled
with her deep black eyes upon them from the table
beyond the stove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t stay away,&#8221; the girl responded lightly.
&#8220;The prairie&#8217;s in my bones.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud had never liked Nevil. To her there was
something fish-like in those pale eyes and overshot
jaw, but just now everybody connected with the old
life was welcome. They chatted for a while, and
presently, as Wanaha began to put the food on the
table, the girl rose to depart.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time I was getting home,&#8221; she said reluctantly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that they know where I am,
so I mustn&#8217;t stay away too long&mdash;after the scrape I
got into months ago. I should like to go across to
the Reservation, but I&#8217;ve already promised not to go
there alone. Seth warned me against it, and after
what has passed I know he&#8217;s right. But I would like
to see Miss Parker, and dear old Mr. Hargreaves.
However, I must wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil crossed over to the table. He looked serious,
but his blue eyes shone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth&#8217;s quite right. You mustn&#8217;t go alone. Little
Black Fox is about again, you know. And&mdash;and
the people are very restless just now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what he said. And I nearly frightened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
auntie to death telling her she&#8217;d get scalped, and
nonsense like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil laughed in response.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d like to go&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only meant I&#8217;ve got to go across directly after
dinner. I could accompany you. No one will interfere
with you while I am there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil turned to his food with apparent indifference.
Wanaha stood patiently by. Rosebud was tempted.
She wanted to see the Reservation again with that
strange longing which all people of impulse have for
revisiting the scenes of old associations. Always she
was possessed by that curious fascination for the
Indian country which was something stronger than
mere association, something that had to do with the
long illness she had passed through nearly seven
years ago.</p>
<p>Nevil waited. He knew by the delay of her
answer that she would accept his invitation, and he
wanted her to go over to the Reservation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure I shan&#8217;t be in the way? Sure I&#8217;m
not troubling you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;By no means. Just let me have my dinner, and
I&#8217;ll be ready. I&#8217;ve half a dozen cords of wood to
haul into Beacon, and I have to go and borrow ponies
for the work. The roads are so bad just now that
my own ponies couldn&#8217;t do it by themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud&#8217;s scruples thus being quieted she returned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
to her seat on the bed, and they talked on while the
man ate his dinner. She watched the almost slavish
devotion of Wanaha with interest and sympathy, but
her feelings were all for the tall, beautiful woman.
For the man she had no respect. She tolerated him
because of her friend only.</p>
<p>An hour later they were on the Reservation. And
they had come by way of the ford. Rosebud was all
interest, and everything else was forgotten, even her
dislike of Nevil, as they made their way past Little
Black Fox&#8217;s house, and through the encampment
of which it was the centre. She was still more delighted
when her companion paused and spoke to
some of the Indians idling about there. She was
free to watch the squaws, and the papooses she
loved so well. The little savages were running wild
about the tepees, dodging amongst the trailers and
poles, or frolicking with the half-starved currish
camp dogs. The air was busy with shrieks of delight,
and frequently through it all could be detected
the note of small ferocity, native to these little red-skinned
creatures.</p>
<p>It was all so familiar to her, so homely, so different
from that other life she had just left. The past few
months were utterly forgotten; she was back in her
old world again. Back in the only world she really
knew and loved.</p>
<p>It came as no sort of surprise to her, when, in the
midst of this scene, the great chief himself appeared.
He came alone, without ceremony or attendants.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
He stood in the midst of the clearing&mdash;tall, commanding,
and as handsome as ever. His dusky face was
wreathed in a proud, half disdainful smile. He did
not attempt to draw near, and, except for a haughty
inclination of the head, made no sign.</p>
<p>Rosebud had no suspicion. She had no thought
of the man with her. She was far too interested in
all she saw to wonder how the chief came to be in
the midst of the clearing just as she was passing
through it.</p>
<p>On the far side of the camp a path led to the
Agency. Its course was tortuous, winding in the
shape of the letter S. It was at the second curve
that an unexpected, and to Nevil, at least, unwelcome
meeting occurred.</p>
<p>Seth, mounted on his own tough broncho, was
standing close against the backing of brush which
lined the way. He had every appearance of having
been awaiting their coming. Nevil&#8217;s furtive eyes
turned hither and thither with the quick glance of a
man who prefers a safe retreat to a bold encounter.</p>
<p>Rosebud looked serious, and thought of the scolding
that might be forthcoming. Then she laughed
and urged her horse quickly forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Seth&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she cried. But she broke off
abruptly. The rest of what she was about to say
died out of her mind. Seth was not even looking at
her. His eyes were on Nevil Steyne in a hard, cold
stare. Physically weak as he was there could be no
mistaking the utter hatred conveyed in that look.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>Rosebud had drawn up beside him. For once she
was at a loss, helpless. Nevil was some ten yards in
rear of her. There was a moment&#8217;s silence after the
girl&#8217;s greeting, then Seth said quite sharply&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You stay right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He urged his horse forward and went to meet
Nevil. The girl was very anxious, hardly knowing
why. She heard Seth&#8217;s voice low but commanding.
His words were lost upon her, but their effect was
plain enough. Nevil first smiled contemptuously,
then he paled and finally turned his horse about,
and slowly returned the way he had come.</p>
<p>Then, and not until then, Rosebud observed that
Seth was grasping the butt of his revolver.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>ROSEBUD&#8217;S FORTUNE</h3>
</div>

<p>Something of the old spirit seemed to have gone
out of Rosebud when Seth rode back to her. A
strange fascination held her; and now, as he came
up, she had no thought of questioning him, no desire.
She was ready to obey. She watched the
emaciated figure as it drew near with eyes that told
a story which only he could have misinterpreted.
She was ready for a scolding, a scolding which she
felt she merited. But Seth made no attempt to
blame her. And this very fact made her wish that
he would.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Rosie, gal, I guess we&#8217;ll be gettin&#8217; back,&#8221;
he said, in a manner which suggested that they had
been out together merely, and that it was time for
returning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Seth.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was unusual humility in the reply. It may
have been that the girl remembered that scene in
the woods so many months ago. Perhaps the scene
she had just witnessed had told her something that
no explanations could have made so clear. Seth
was always the dominating factor in their intercourse,
but this outward submission was quite foreign
to the girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>They rode off together, the man&#8217;s horse leading
slightly. Neither spoke for a while, but Rosebud
noticed that almost imperceptibly they had branched
off and were heading for the bridge by unfrequented
by-paths which frequently demanded their riding in
Indian-file.</p>
<p>Seth displayed no haste and no inclination to talk,
and the silence soon began to jar on the girl. It
was one thing for her to give ready obedience, but
to be led like some culprit marching to execution
was something which roused her out of her docility.
At the first opportunity she ranged her horse alongside
her companion&#8217;s and asserted her presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to answer me a question, Seth,&#8221; she
said quietly. &#8220;How did you get wounded?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s face never relaxed a muscle, but there
was a dryness in the tone of his reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess some bussock of a feller got monkeyin&#8217;
with a gun an&#8217; didn&#8217;t know a heap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud favored him with a little knowing smile.
They were still amidst the broken woodlands, and
she was quick to observe her companion&#8217;s swift-moving
eyes as they flashed this way and that in
their ceaseless watchfulness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not to be cheated. Some one shot at you
who meant&mdash;business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I ain&#8217;t aware jest how he figgered, Rosie.&#8221;
A smile accompanied Seth&#8217;s words this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, who did it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never seen him; so I can&#8217;t rightly say.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you guess?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t good at guessin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, I won&#8217;t bother you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then after a little silence the man spoke again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those letters of yours was mortal fine,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Seems to me I could most find my way around
London, with its stores an&#8217; nigglin&#8217; trails. It&#8217;s a
tol&#8217;ble city. A mighty good eddication, travelin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it is.&#8221; Rosebud seemed to have lost
her desire for conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Makes you think some,&#8221; Seth went on, heedless
of the girl&#8217;s abstraction. &#8220;Makes you feel as the
sun don&#8217;t jest rise and set on your own p&#8217;tickler
patch o&#8217; ploughin&#8217;. Makes you feel you&#8217;re kind o&#8217;
like a grain o&#8217; wheat at seedin&#8217; time. I allow a man
don&#8217;t amount to a heap noways.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud turned on him with a bright smile in her
wonderful eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends, Seth. I should say a man is as
he chooses to make himself. I met a lot of men in
England; some of them were much better than others.
Some were extremely nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221; Seth turned his earnest eyes on the girl&#8217;s
face. He lost the significance of the mischievous
down-turning of the corners of her mouth. &#8220;I guess
them gilt-edge folk are a dandy lot. Y&#8217; see them
&#8217;lords&#8217; an&#8217; such, they&#8217;ve got to be pretty nigh the
mark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, I suppose they have.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>There was another brief pause while the man&#8217;s
eyes glanced keenly about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you mixed a deal with them sort o&#8217; folk,&#8221;
he went on presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221; The violet eyes were again alight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty tidy sort o&#8217; fellers, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather. I liked one or two very much&mdash;very
much indeed. There was Bob&mdash;Bob Vinceps, you
know&mdash;he was a splendid fellow. He was awfully
nice to me. Took auntie and me everywhere. I
wonder how he&#8217;s getting on. I must see if there&#8217;s
a letter from him at Beacon. He asked me if he
might write. And wasn&#8217;t it nice of him, Seth? He
came all the way from London to Liverpool to see
me, I mean us, off. It&#8217;s a long way&mdash;a dreadful
long way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, mebbe when I go into Beacon Crossing I&#8217;ll
fetch that letter out for you, Rosie.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Seth&#8217;s simple-heartedness&mdash;Rosebud called it
&#8220;stupidity,&#8221;&mdash;was too much. The girl&#8217;s smile vanished
in a second and she answered sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, I&#8217;ll get my own letters.&#8221; Then she went
on demurely. &#8220;You see if there happened to be a
letter from Bob I shouldn&#8217;t like auntie to see it. She
is very&mdash;very&mdash;well, she mightn&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth looked squarely into the face beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;She thinks&mdash;well, you see, she says I&#8217;m very
young, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I tho&#8217;t mebbe ther&#8217;s suthin&#8217; agin him. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
see, Rosie, ther&#8217; mustn&#8217;t be anythin&#8217; agin the man
you marry. He&#8217;s got to be a jo-dandy clear thro&#8217;.
I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not going to marry Lord Vinceps, you
silly, at least&mdash;I don&#8217;t think so. Besides,&#8221; as an
afterthought, &#8220;it&#8217;s nothing to you who I marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, no. Mebbe that&#8217;s so, only ef you&#8217;d get
hitched, as the sayin&#8217; is, to some mule-headed son
of a gun that wa&#8217;n&#8217;t squar&#8217; by you, I&#8217;d git around
an&#8217; drop him in his tracks, ef I had to cross the water
to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud listened with a queer stirring at her heart,
yet she could not repress the impatience she felt at
the calm matter-of-fact manner in which the threat
was made. The one redeeming point about it was
that she knew one of Seth&#8217;s quiet assurances to be
far more certain, far more deadly, than anybody&#8217;s else
wildest spoken threats. However, she laughed as
she answered him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you won&#8217;t have to cross the ocean to find
the man I marry. I&#8217;m not going to England again,
except, perhaps, on a business visit. I intend to stay
here, unless Pa and Ma turn me out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth caught his breath. For a second his whole
face lit up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, I didn&#8217;t jest take you right,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to stay right here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud gave a joyous little nod. She had stirred
Seth out of his usual calm. There was no mistaking
the light in his hollow eyes. He made no movement,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
he spoke as quietly as ever, but the girl saw
something in his eyes that set her heart beating like
a steam hammer. The next moment she was chilled
as though she had received a cold douche.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he went on imperturbably.
&#8220;Real sorry. Which I mean lookin&#8217; at it reas&#8217;nable.
&#8217;Tain&#8217;t right. You belong ther&#8217;. Ther&#8217;s your folk
an&#8217; your property, an&#8217; the dollars. You jest ought
to fix up wi&#8217; some high soundin&#8217; feller&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth, mind your own business!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud&#8217;s exasperation broke all bounds. If a
look could have withered him Seth would have
shriveled to bare bones. The next moment the girl&#8217;s
lips trembled and two big tears rolled slowly down
her cheeks. She urged her horse ahead of her companion
and kept that lead until they had crossed the
bridge. Seth&#8217;s eyes, busy in every other direction,
had failed to witness her distress, just as he failed to
take any heed of her words.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Rosie, ther&#8217;s a heap o&#8217; trouble comin&#8217;
along here,&#8221; he said presently, when he had drawn
level.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the girl replied, without turning her head;
&#8220;and I&#8217;m going to stay for it. Auntie can go back
when she likes, but this is my home, and&mdash;Seth, why
do you always want to be rid of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth remained silent for a moment. Then he spoke
in a voice that was a little unsteady.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be rid of you, Rosie. No; I&#8217;m
jest thinkin&#8217; of you,&#8221; he added.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>The old impulsive Rosebud was uppermost in an
instant. She turned on him, and reached out a hand
which he took in both of his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth, you are a dear, and I&#8217;m sorry for being so
rude to you. It&#8217;s always been like this, hasn&#8217;t it?
You&#8217;ve always thought of me, for me. I wish, sometimes,
you wouldn&#8217;t think&mdash;for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She withdrew her hand, and, touching her horse
with her heel, galloped on toward the farm, leaving
Seth to come on behind. She gave him no chance
of overtaking her this time.</p>
<p>Supper-time brought a lively scene with it. Rosebud,
for some unexplained reason, was in a more
than usually contradictory mood. Mrs. Rickards
had thoroughly enjoyed her day in spite of the sloppy
condition of everything outside the house. She was
a woman who took a deep interest in life. She was
worldly and practical in all matters which she considered
to be the business of a woman&#8217;s life, but her
mental vision was not bounded by such a horizon.</p>
<p>Everything interested her, provided her personal
comfort was not too much disturbed. The farm was
strange, new, and as such was welcome, but Ma
Sampson was a study which fascinated her. She
was in the best of spirits when the little family gathered
for the evening meal. This had been much
elaborated by Ma in her visitors&#8217; honor.</p>
<p>At this repast came her first real chance of observing
Seth. She studied him for some time in silence
while the others talked. Then she joined in the conversation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
herself, and quickly contrived to twist it
into the direction she required.</p>
<p>They were laughing over Rosebud&#8217;s attempt to
scare her cousin with her threat of the Indians.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, auntie,&#8221; the girl said roguishly, &#8220;you
are a &#8217;tenderfoot.&#8217; It is always the privilege of &#8217;old
hands&#8217; to ridicule newcomers. In your world there
is little for you to learn. In ours you must be duly
initiated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In my world?&#8221; Mrs. Rickards smiled and
raised her eyebrows. She had a pleasant smile
which lit up her round fat face till she looked the
picture of hearty good-nature. And she was on the
whole decidedly good-natured. Only her good-nature
never ran away with her. &#8220;My dear, why
not your world also? This is not your world any
longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma smiled down upon the teapot, while the men
waited expectantly. With all their simplicity, these
people understood Rosebud as far as it was possible
to understand her. Without appearing too keen,
each watched the violet eyes as they opened wide
and wondering by upon the cousin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, auntie! I&mdash;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You belong to the same world as I do. Dakota
no longer claims you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;England.&#8221; Rosebud laughed; and
at least three people understood that laugh.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rickards turned to Ma.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, Mrs. Sampson, Rosebud has never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
yet regarded her position seriously. She is curiously
situated&mdash;but pleasantly, if she will only enter into
the spirit of her father&#8217;s will. Has she told you about
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma shook her head. The men went on with their
meal in silence. At this point the subject of her
aunt&#8217;s talk broke in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, auntie, you tell the story. You are the
prosecution, I am the defendant, and these are the
judges. I&#8217;ll have my say last, so fire ahead.&#8221; There
was a look of determination in the girl&#8217;s eyes as she
laughingly challenged her aunt.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rickards smiled indulgently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, my dear; but for goodness&#8217; sake don&#8217;t
be so slangy. Now Mrs. Sampson and&mdash;gentlemen
of the jury. Is that right, Rosie?&#8221; The girl nodded,
and her aunt went on. &#8220;You must quite understand
I am entirely disinterested in Rosie&#8217;s affairs. My
only interest is that I have found it possible to&mdash;er&mdash;tolerate
this madcap, and she has found it possible
to put up with me; in fact I am her nominal guardian&mdash;by
mutual choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve hit it dead centre, auntie,&#8221; interrupted
the girl mischievously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t interrupt or&mdash;I&#8217;ll clear the court. Well,
the child comes to me fresh from the prairie. She is
good as good can be; but she is quite helpless in her
new life. And more than this she is burdened&mdash;I say
it advisedly&mdash;with great wealth under, what I consider,
an extraordinary will. How the colonel came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
to make such a will I cannot understand. The only
thing I can think of is that when that will was made
he feared there might be some person or persons,
possibly relatives, into whose hands she might fall,
when she was young, and who might misuse her fortune.
This is surmise. Anyway, after providing for
her mother he leaves everything to Rosebud. But
the legacy is not to take effect until the day she
marries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Further, the property left to her mother devolved
upon her at her mother&#8217;s death. This, of course,
she has already inherited; the rest still remains in
trust. Now, of course, as the child&#8217;s social mother,
it is my first duty to watch the men with whom she
comes into contact. I have given her every opportunity
to meet the most eligible bachelors. Men of
title and wealth. Men who cannot possibly be
charged with fortune-hunting. What is the result?
She sends them all to the right-about. She is positively
rude to them&mdash;little barbarian. And the others&mdash;the
undesirables&mdash;well, she just encourages them
outrageously.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, auntie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute. The prosecution has not done
yet. Now, Mrs. Sampson, I ask you, what am I to
do? The truth is she can marry whom she pleases.
I have no power over her. I feel sure she will throw
herself away on some dreadful, undesirable fortune-hunter.
She is in such a position that no poor man
can ask her to marry him without becoming a fortune-hunter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
Why, out of all the people she has met
since she has been with me, who do you think she
encourages? Quite the worst man I know. Lord
Vinceps. He&#8217;s a peer, I know; but he&#8217;s poor, and
up to his neck in debts. She is a great trial.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled fondly at the girl whose shortcomings
were causing her so much anxiety. But there was
no answering smile to meet hers. Rosebud&#8217;s face
was serious for once, and her beautiful eyes quite
cold. Mrs. Rickards had addressed herself to Ma,
but the girl knew well enough, and resented the fact,
that her words were meant for another. Rube and
Seth still remained silent. But the impeachment was
not allowed to pass unchallenged. Rosebud was up
in arms at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;About Lord Vinceps, auntie; you know that is
all nonsense. I don&#8217;t care if I never see him again.
I understood him within five minutes of our meeting.
And that understanding would never permit me to
think twice about him. He is a cheerful companion;
but&mdash;no, auntie, count him out. As for the others&mdash;no,
thanks. The man I marry will have to be a man,
some one who, when I do wrong, can figuratively
take me across his knee. The man I marry must be
my master, auntie. Don&#8217;t be shocked. I mean it.
And I haven&#8217;t met such a man under your roof. You
see all my ideas are savage, barbarous.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl paused. Ma&#8217;s smile had broadened.
Rosebud had not changed. Rube listened in open-mouthed
astonishment. He was out of his depth,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
but enjoying himself. Seth alone gave no sign of
approval or otherwise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, look here, auntie,&#8221; Rosebud had gathered
herself together for a final blow. One little hand was
clenched, and it rested on the edge of the table ready
to emphasize her words. &#8220;I do regard my position
seriously. But I have to live my life myself, and will
not be trammeled by any conventions of your social
world. I&#8217;ll marry whom I please, because I want to,
and not because the world says I ought to do so.
Rest assured, I won&#8217;t marry any fortune-hunter. The
man I marry I shall be able to love, honor, and obey,
or I&#8217;ll not marry at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl suddenly rose from her seat. Her color
heightened. There was something in her manner
that kept her aunt&#8217;s eyes fixed upon her in wondering
anticipation. She watched her move round the
table and lean over and kiss Ma on the crown of the
head, and then pass on to Rube, round whose neck
she gently placed her arms. Thus she stood for a
second looking smilingly over the great rough head
across at Ma, who, like the others, was wondering
what was coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Furthermore I am not going back to England
any more unless I am turned out of here. You
won&#8217;t turn me out, Pa, will you?&#8221; She bent down
and softly rubbed her cheek against Rube&#8217;s bristling
face.</p>
<p>There was a dead silence. Then Mrs. Rickards
broke in weakly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but your&mdash;property?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I arranged that with Mr. Irvine before I came
out. It&#8217;s no use, auntie, I am quite determined.
That is&mdash;you won&#8217;t&mdash;you won&#8217;t turn me out, Pa,
will you? I&#8217;ll be so good. I&#8217;ll never do anything
wrong, and I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll even hoe potatoes if any one
wants me to.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s laughing eyes shot a mischievous glance
in Seth&#8217;s direction. Rube raised one great hand and
drew her face to his and kissed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess this is your home if you&#8217;ve a notion to it,
Rosie, gal. Guess Ma wants you, jest as we all do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma nodded and beamed through her glasses.
Seth smiled in his slow fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I guess I ain&#8217;t bustin&#8217; fer you to hoe p&#8217;taters
neither,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For a moment Mrs. Rickards looked about her
helplessly; she hardly knew what to say. Then, at
last, she, too, joined in the spirit which pervaded the
party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you are the strangest creature&mdash;but there,
I said you were a little savage, and so did Mr. Seth.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH THE UNDERCURRENT BELIES THE SUPERFICIAL CALM</h3>
</div>

<p>THE snow is gone, and the earth is passing through
a process of airing. The sun licks up the moisture
like some creature possessed of an unquenchable
thirst. Wherever it is sufficiently dry the settlers are
already at work seeding. Some are even breaking
virgin soil, or turning over old ploughing. There is
an atmosphere of leisurely industry about the plains.
Even in these unsettled regions work goes forward
with precision. The farmer&#8217;s life is one of routine
with which he permits nothing to interfere. He lives
by the fruits of the earth which ripen in due season.
If fortune favors him he reaps the harvest. Whatever
his lot he must accept it. The elements rule
his life. The Indians may or may not disorganize
the process.</p>
<p>The folk on White River Farm are in no way behind
their neighbors. Seth&#8217;s returning strength permits
him to take his share in the work, and thus Rube
finds his burden lightened. But only partially, for
Seth has much else to do, or seems to have, for he
has many comings and goings which take up time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rickards is still staying on at the farm. She
thoroughly enjoys this new, simple life. Besides, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
the brief fortnight which has elapsed since her coming,
she has learnt something of the true worth, the
wonderful kindliness and honesty of these frontier-folk.</p>
<p>Even Seth, whom at first she was less certain
about, she has learned to look upon with favor. His
silent, direct fashion of going through his daily life
has given her an inkling of qualities, which, if not altogether
companionable, show a manliness she has
not always been accustomed to.</p>
<p>Her change of opinion found vent one night at
bedtime. Rosebud listened to the worldly-wise
woman&#8217;s remarks with a glow of pleasure and pride.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth is a queer fellow, Rosie, so darkly reticent
and all that,&#8221; she said, with a thoughtful smile. &#8220;Do
you know I sometimes think if I were in great danger&mdash;personal
danger, you know&mdash;he&#8217;s the sort of man
I&#8217;d like to have about. He gives me the impression
of a great reserve of strength. He is what one
might&mdash;well, what you would call a &#8216;man.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud added her word without the least hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s more than that, auntie; he&#8217;s the bravest and
best man in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so, my dear; and in consequence you don&#8217;t
want to return to England,&#8221; Mrs. Rickards said
slyly.</p>
<p>Rosebud encountered the glance which accompanied
the words. She shook her head with a little
despairing gesture.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But he loves me only as a sort of daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he, my dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rickards&#8217; tone was quite incredulous; she
was at home in matters of love and marriage.</p>
<p>The object of all this thought went about blissfully
unconscious of the heart stirrings he was causing.
Every moment of his life was full&mdash;full to the
brim and even overflowing. There was not a settler
in the district whom he had not visited during the
fortnight. And his business was with the men
alone.</p>
<p>The result of his visits would have been visible
to the eye of only the most experienced. Work
went on the same as before, but there were many
half hours which might have been spent in well-earned
idleness now devoted by the men to a quiet,
undemonstrative overhauling of their armory.</p>
<p>As it was at these outlying farms so it was at
White River. In the short twilight of evening Rube
and Seth would wander round their buildings and
the stockade, noting this defect, suggesting this
alteration, or that repair. All their ideas were based
on the single thought of emergency. Large supplies
of cord-wood were brought in and stacked on the
inner side of the stockade, thus adding to its powers
of resistance. Every now and then Ma would receive
casually dropped hints on the subject of her
storeroom. A large supply of ammunition arrived
from Beacon Crossing. Many cases of tinned provisions
came along, and Ma, wondering, took them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
in without question or comment at the time. Later
in the day when she happened to find Seth alone
she told him of them, adopting a casual tone, the
tone which these people invariably assumed when
the signs of the times wore their most significant
aspect.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a heap of canned truck come from
the Crossing, Seth,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I laid it down in
the cellars. Maybe you sent it along?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Seth replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, Ma. I figgered we&#8217;d like a change
from fresh meat. You see I happened along to
Beacon Crossing, an&#8217; I guessed I&#8217;d save a journey
later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma&#8217;s bright old eyes read all there was underlying
her boy&#8217;s words, and she, like the rest, continued
steadily on with her work.</p>
<p>So the days crept slowly by. Now the snow and
ice were gone, and the tawny hue of the prairie was
tinged with that perfect emerald of budding spring.
The woodlands of the river and the Reservation had
lost their barren blackness. The earth was opening
its eyes and stretching itself after its months of
heavy slumber. Life was in the very air of the
plains. The whole world seemed to be bursting
with renewed life.</p>
<p>Seth was now restored to something like his old
self. His vigor was a thing to marvel at. His
regular day&#8217;s work was only a tithe of what he did.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
That which went on after the rest of the household
had retired to rest was known to only two others.
Rube possessed the younger man&#8217;s confidence, and
Jimmy Parker was in constant communication with
him. Seth and the latter worked hand in hand for
the common welfare, but they were silent. Each
knew the character of the dangers which ever surrounded
them. Each knew that an absolute silence
and apparent indifference were the only means of
learning the plans, the meaning of the furtive unrest
of the warlike Sioux. All that they learned
was carefully stored and docketed for future reference.</p>
<p>Parker&#8217;s responsibility was official. Seth&#8217;s was
voluntary and humanitarian. Now he had a double
incentive. Rosebud was in danger. He knew that
he alone stood between her and the treacherous
machinations of Nevil Steyne, and the lawless passion
of an unscrupulous savage. He dared not
spare himself. He must know of every movement
on the Reservation. He quite understood the men
he was dealing with. He knew the motive of each.
All he hoped was that he might prove himself just a
shade cleverer, a shade quicker in emergency when
the time came for him to act.</p>
<p>It was impossible, however, that Seth should leave
the house night after night and no member of the
household be the wiser. Oddly enough it was Mrs.
Rickards&#8217; maid who discovered his movements.
She, with a discretion which a confidential servant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
may always be expected to possess, whispered her
discovery to her mistress, and her mistress was not
slow in drawing Rosebud&#8217;s attention. As they were
retiring one night she told the girl of her maid&#8217;s
discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Janet tells me that Mr. Seth goes out every night
and doesn&#8217;t return till two or three in the morning,
Rosie,&#8221; she said abruptly, as she was preparing for
bed. &#8220;You know the girl sleeps over the kitchen,
and some nights ago she saw him ride off from the
barn in the moonlight. Last night she was awake
when he got back. It was daylight. I wonder
where he goes?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud responded in a matter-of-fact tone, but
with a quick look at her friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rickards wondered and speculated on, but
Rosebud&#8217;s manner gave her no encouragement, and
she was fain to let the matter drop. There was no
malice in her remarks, but a very profound curiosity.</p>
<p>Her announcement had its effect.</p>
<p>The next night Rosebud did not go to bed after
retiring to their room. She made no explanation,
merely telling her aunt that she was not going to bed
yet. And Mrs. Rickards nodded a comprehensive
smile at her.</p>
<p>The girl waited a reasonable time till she thought
the others were asleep, then she crept softly down-stairs.
She went into the kitchen, but it was dark
and empty. The parlor was also in darkness, except
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
for the moonlight pouring in through the window.
But as she stood in the doorway, peering closely into
the remoter corners, she felt a cool draught playing
upon her face. Then she saw that the door opening
on the verandah was open.</p>
<p>She walked across the room, and, looking out on
the moonlit scene, was promptly greeted by a low
growl from General. The next moment she stepped
out, and beheld Seth&#8217;s tall figure leaning against one
of the great gate-posts of the stockade, while General
came over to her and rubbed his keen nose against
her skirts.</p>
<p>Just for a moment she hesitated. It suddenly occurred
to her that her action might be construed into
spying, and she was possessed by a sense of shame
at the bare thought. She knew that she was not
spying in the baser sense of the word. She had no
doubts of Seth. Instinct told her why he was out.
She had come to find out the facts, but not by spying.
She meant to question him.</p>
<p>She felt her heart thumping in her chest as she
stepped quickly across the verandah. She was nervous,
and a strange feeling of shyness made her long
to turn back before the man became aware of her
presence. But she controlled the impulse, and,
though feeling herself flush in the cool air of the
night, walked bravely on.</p>
<p>She believed she was unobserved. Her slippers
gave out no sound, but as she came within a few
yards of the still figure, the man&#8217;s voice greeted her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thought you was abed, Rosie.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl started at the sound. Seth had not
moved, had not even turned his head. Then she
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know I was here?&#8221; she said quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I heard General talkin&#8217; to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was at his side now.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you never looked round?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ef it was Rube, I&#8217;d have heard his feet. Ma ain&#8217;t
wanderin&#8217; around o&#8217; nights. An&#8217; I guess your auntie
ain&#8217;t bustin&#8217; fer a moonlight ramble. It didn&#8217;t need
a heap o&#8217; figgerin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud had no answer ready. The argument
was so simple.</p>
<p>A brief silence fell, while both looked out across
the moonlit plains at the dark line of distant woods.
There was a slight glow in the sky in two different
directions. One was away over the Pine Ridge Reservation,
the other was nearer at hand, but on the far
side of the Rosebud Reservation. The girl saw these
things and they held her silent. Her breathing came
quickly. There was a sensation of excitement running
through her body. She knew these lights were
what Seth was staring at.</p>
<p>The man stirred at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;d best git back to bed, Rosie,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to saddle up my plug. I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to ride some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; The girl&#8217;s question
came with a little nervous energy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></p>
<p>The man turned upon her gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m meetin&#8217; Parker to-night,&#8221; he said briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; The violet eyes held the other&#8217;s
with their steady gaze. The pretty, irregular face
was set and determined.</p>
<p>Seth moved. Then he turned away to glance at
the lurid reflection in the sky. Presently his eyes
came back to her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s them,&#8221; he said, indicating the reflected
fires.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what are they?&#8221; Rosebud&#8217;s voice was
quietly commanding. The irresponsible girl had
gone from the woman talking now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sun-dances. They&#8217;re doin&#8217; it at night to cover
their tracks. The Injuns are gettin&#8217; wise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no avoiding the sharp, direct questioning.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re goin&#8217; to git it, and when it comes it&#8217;ll be&mdash;sudden.
Sudden an&#8217; bad. It&#8217;s both Reservations.
All of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud was silent. Her wide open eyes were on
the lights, but her thoughts were on other things,&mdash;so
many other things, that her head whirled. At
last she spoke again, in a tense, nervous manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about it. Tell me all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t a deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See you, Rosie, ef I go out o&#8217; here presently, will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
you jest close these gates an&#8217; fix &#8217;em? An&#8217; will you
be up to open &#8217;em for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth gazed at the horizon again.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I said, ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t much,&#8221; he began presently.
&#8220;This has been goin&#8217; on fer days. Ther&#8217;s Injuns out
most every night, an&#8217; they are lyin&#8217; this side o&#8217; the
fort. They&#8217;re all about it, an&#8217; them soldier-fellers
ain&#8217;t wise to it. What&#8217;s more we darsen&#8217;t to put &#8217;em
wise. They&#8217;re li&#8217;ble to butt right in, an&#8217; then ther&#8217;
won&#8217;t be any stoppin&#8217; them pesky redskins. Y&#8217; see
ther&#8217;s only a handful at the fort, an&#8217; the Injuns could
eat &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you always said it was a mistake to bluff
with soldiers so near the Reservation. I suppose the
Indians resent their presence. Is that it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another reason?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t rightly say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud knew that the man was prevaricating.</p>
<p>She stood lost in thought for some moments. And
as she thought a sudden light came to her. She
drew closer to her companion and laid one hand on
his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I see, Seth,&#8221; she said, and then became
silent.</p>
<p>The man moved, and his action was almost a rebuff.
That touch had stirred him. The gentle pressure
of her hand sent the blood coursing through his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
veins, and he restrained the hot, passionate words
that sprang to his lips only with a great effort. The
girl accepted his movement as a rebuff and shrank
away. But she spoke vehemently.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d only thought&mdash;oh, if I&#8217;d only thought! I
should have known. All that has gone before should
have told me. It is my coming back that has precipitated
matters.&#8221; Her voice had sunk to a low
tone of humility and self-accusation. &#8220;And, Seth,
now I understand why you were shot. It was Little
Black Fox. And I, fool that I was, dared to show
myself on the Reservation. And he saw me. I
might have known, I might have known.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a piteous ring in her low tones. Seth
stirred again, but she went on desperately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I see it all. A descent will be made upon
us, upon this farm. You will be done to death for
me. Ma and Pa, and auntie and&mdash;and you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused, but went on again at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I see further now. I see what you have
already grasped. They have these scouts out around
the fort to watch. When it comes they mean to cut
the soldiers off. There will be no help for us. Only&mdash;only
this stockade. Oh, Seth, how can you forgive
me! You and Pa have foreseen all this trouble.
And you have prepared for it all you can. Is there
no help? Can I do nothing to atone for what I have
done? You stand there without a word of blame
for me. You never blame me&mdash;any of you. I wish
I were dead! Seth, why don&#8217;t you kill me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>But as the girl&#8217;s hysterical outburst reached its
culminating point, Seth regained perfect mastery of
himself. He noted the rush of tears which followed
her words with a pang of infinite pity, but he told
himself that he dare not attempt to comfort her. Instead,
his calm voice, with its wonderful power of reassurance,
fell upon the stillness of the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little gal, things are jest as they must be. The
blame is on me fer not bein&#8217; quicker an&#8217; handier wi&#8217;
my gun when I had the chance. But, howsum,
Parker&#8217;s a hefty man. He ken think an&#8217; act quick.
We&#8217;re ready, far as we ken be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud dried her tears. Never in her life had
Seth appeared to her as he appeared now. The
steady, unruffled purpose of the man exalted him in
her eyes to an impossible position. Somehow the
feelings he roused in her lifted her out of her womanly
weakness. She, too, was capable of great, unswerving
devotion, but she did not realize it. She only
felt that she, too, must bear her part in whatever
fortune had in store for them. She would range herself
beside this man and share in his success or failure.
If it were to be failure she was ready to die at
his side. If it were success&mdash;a great exultation
swept over her at the thought. She went no further.
Success at his side would be worth&mdash;everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me what I can do&mdash;anything!&#8221; she cried.
Her tone was low, but it rang with a note the man
had never heard in it before. There was a joy in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
it that startled him. &#8220;Seth, I believe&mdash;I know&mdash;I
want to&mdash;to fight. My blood is running like fire.
Tell me what I am to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a few moments before Seth answered her.
He was thinking hard. He knew she could do much.
But he was debating with himself. A great pride
was his as he contemplated the small face with its
wonderful eyes out of which looked such steadfast
courage. He, too, thrilled at the thought of fighting
at her side, but he tried to tell himself that he had no
right to ask anything of her. Perhaps Rosebud saw
the drift of his thoughts in his face, for she gave him
no chance of denial.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the gates. That&#8217;s all right. I understand.
Now, what else? Can&#8217;t I reconnoitre, or&mdash;or something
in the meantime?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her enthusiasm carried the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I guess not. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See, Rosie, we want time. I kind o&#8217; think it&#8217;s to-morrow.
Parker thinks so too. So does Hargreaves.
We may be wrong. But&mdash;see right here, I&#8217;m due
back here by two o&#8217;clock sure. If I&#8217;m not here by
ten minutes after ther&#8217;s this you ken do. Go straight
back o&#8217; the barn &#8217;bout a hundred paces; on the hill
are two bunches of stuff piled up, one&#8217;s wood, t&#8217;other&#8217;s
dried grass an&#8217; stuff. You go right out an&#8217; kindle
&#8217;em both. They&#8217;re signals to the settlers around.
Guess ther&#8217;s eyes watchin&#8217; for &#8217;em at every farm.
When you see &#8217;em burnin&#8217; steady, git right back and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
rouse Rube an&#8217; Ma. I&#8217;ll git back later&mdash;sure. An&#8217;
ther&#8217;ll be others with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Anything more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope. I &#8217;lows I&#8217;ll saddle up.&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked back to the barn in silence. Seth
saddled his horse and brought him out. Together
they walked to the gate of the stockade. They still
remained silent. At the gate the man mounted.
Rosebud, very frail looking in the moonlight, stood
beside him smoothing the horse&#8217;s silky neck. Her
face was anxious but determined. Suddenly she
looked up. Her great eyes were full of appeal.
There was no wavering in her gaze, nothing but sincerity
and appeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth, dear,&#8221; she said in a steady voice, &#8220;be careful
of yourself&mdash;for my sake.&#8221; Then, lowering her
gaze, and turning to the distant reflection of the fires,
&#8220;Remember, we all depend on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember, Rosie, gal,&#8221; the man replied, with
a tender inflection he could not altogether repress.
&#8220;So long.&#8221;</p>
<p>The horse moved away with General at its
heels.</p>
<p>For a long time Rosebud stood where the parting
had left her. Now that Seth had gone she was a
prey to every womanly anxiety. And her anxiety
was solely for him. None of those peacefully slumbering
in the house entered into her thoughts. Her
care was for this one man; his image filled her heart.
At that moment hers was the selfishness of a maiden&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
first great love. Even in her anxiety her thoughts
were not unhappy ones.</p>
<p>At last she moved away, and with the action came
a desire to do. Unknown to her the spirit of her
dead father and mother roused within her. She was
a woman, gentle, loving, but strong with an invincible
courage which had been handed down to
her from those two brave souls of whom she had no
recollection. Time would prove if the tragedy of the
parents should fall upon the child.</p>
<p>Quietly she stole up-stairs to her bedroom. Her
cousin was still sleeping. She opened a chest of
drawers and drew out an old leather belt filled with
ammunition, and bearing two holsters containing a
pair of revolvers. These had been a present from
Seth in the old days. She loaded both weapons, and
then secured them about her waist. Then she
closed the drawer, and crept noiselessly down-stairs
again.</p>
<p>She made her way out into the moonlight. Passing
out of the stockade she located the exact position
of the beacon-fires. The forethought in their arrangement
pleased her. She understood that the
wood-fire was for night, and the grass and dung for
day. The smoke of the latter would be easily detected
in the brightest sunlight. She came back and
barred the gates, and sat out on the verandah with a
small metal clock beside her. Thus her vigil began.</p>
<p>The time crept by. Twelve, one, two o&#8217;clock.
Seth had not returned. She gave him the exact ten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
minutes&#8217; grace. Then, her face pale and a little
drawn by the unaccustomed strain, she went out and
lit the beacons. She obeyed implicitly. There was
no haste, no fear. Her heart was thumping hard in
her bosom as she came and went, but it was not with
fear.</p>
<p>Finally she roused Rube and Ma. Returning to
the verandah she was in time to answer a sharp
summons at the gates. To her dismay she discovered
that Seth had not returned. The Agent
and Mr. Hargreaves had brought their womenfolk.
The minister greeted the girl with a quiet announcement
which lost nothing of its significance by the
easy manner in which it was made.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re out, Rosie,&#8221; he said. And a moment
later the gates were closed behind the party.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>THE SUN-DANCE</h3>
</div>

<p>The pale moon shone down upon a strange
scene.</p>
<p>Four great fires marked the limits of a wide clearing.
And these were set with consummate accuracy
at the cardinal points. Superstition demanded this
setting.</p>
<p>The ruddy glow threw into uncertain relief the
faces and unkempt figures of a vast concourse of
men and women gathered, in one great circle, within
the boundary limits of the fires. On the faces of all
was an expression of fierce revelry. A dark setting
completed the picture. Beyond the fires all was
shadow, profound, ghostly. The woods in all directions
closed in that weird concourse of beings, and
even the devilish light of the fires could not relieve
the savagery of the scene.</p>
<p>Like the hub of a gigantic wheel, in the midst of
the circle stood a cluster of leafless trees, mighty
patriarchs, gnarled and twisted, with great overhanging
limbs as stout and rugged as only hoary age can
make them.</p>
<p>The clearing inside the human circle was empty
for a time, but the crowd without was momentarily
increasing, augmented by an incessant stream of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
dusky, silent figures pouring from the adjacent
forest depths. As the minutes wore on the human
tide slackened; it became broken, finally it ceased
altogether. Men, women and children, all the able-bodied
inhabitants of the Rosebud Reservation had
foregathered, and the significance of the gathering
could not be mistaken.</p>
<p>Now a distant murmur comes from out of the
blackness of the woods. At first it is low, faint, and
without character. But it grows, it gains in power
till its raucous din breaks upon the waiting multitude,
and immediately a responsive murmur rises from ten
thousand voices. Those who hear know the meaning
of the discordant noise. The &#8220;med&#8217;cine&#8221; men
of the tribe are approaching, chanting airs which
accord with their &#8220;med&#8217;cine,&#8221; and serve at the same
time to herald the coming of the great Sioux chief,
Little Black Fox.</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer, louder and louder. All eyes
are upon the black fringe of the forest where the trees
no longer have power to obstruct the moonlight.
And of a sudden a number of writhing, twisting
figures come dancing into view.</p>
<p>They draw nearer to the expectant throng. Necks
are craned, eyes are straining to watch the antics so
significant to these creatures of superstition. For
have not these strange beings power to invoke the
spirits, to drive away evil influence from the path of
him whose approach they herald?</p>
<p>They reach the clearing; they leap within the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
human circle. Their painted faces are distorted with
the effort of their wild exertions; their befeathered
heads are rendered still more hideous by the lurid
blending of conflicting lights. Thirty creatures,
hardly recognizable as human beings, dance to the
accompaniment of a strange crooning of the women
onlookers; to the beating of sad-toned drums, and
the harsh scraping of stringed instruments. But the
dance is marked by a distinct time. It has unmistakable
features and figures, and it proceeds to its
natural finish which leaves the dancers prostrate
upon the ground, with their faces pressed hard into
the dusty earth. It is a wild scene.</p>
<p>But the Sun-dance has only begun. There is
much to follow.</p>
<p>Now a single figure moves out of the crowd, and
takes its position in the arena. It is the young chief.
His attitude is one of sublime dignity. His erect
figure and haughty carriage bear the indelible stamp
of his illustrious forbears. Silently he raises one
hand, and a deathly hush falls upon his people.</p>
<p>And Little Black Fox speaks.</p>
<p>Tall, handsome, lithe, a frame of great bone and
smooth sinewy muscle, he is an imposing figure.
He wears no blanket, just the buckskin, beaded as
becomes his high rank.</p>
<p>He harangues mightily, now working himself into
an almost uncontrolled fury, again letting his voice
die down to that plaintive, musical note which alone
belongs to the Sioux tongue. And his speech is of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
war&mdash;wild, fierce, unreasonable war, such as his
people love. He is thrilling with the untamed spirit
of his ancestors, and every word he utters carries a
ready conviction to the untutored souls to whom it
is addressed.</p>
<p>He sweeps on in a torrential flow of passion, and
those who listen are roused at once to a savage enthusiasm.
There are no interruptions. The oration
is received in complete silence. These are Indians
taken into their sovereign&#8217;s council; they are there
to hear while the young brave pronounces, with all
the fire of his ardent, aboriginal nature, the doom of
their white masters.</p>
<p>The wise men of the council are grouped together
and sit aloof. They sit like mummies, smoking, and
with every appearance of indifference. But their
ears are wide open. One alone displays interest,
and it is noticeable that he is different from all the
rest of the aged group. He is younger. He has
blue eyes and fair hair, and his skin is pale. Yet he,
too, is blanketed like his companions. He listens
acutely to the end of the speech. Then he silently
moves away, and, unheeded, becomes lost in the
adjacent woods.</p>
<p>As the chieftain&#8217;s last words die away the men of
&#8220;med&#8217;cine&#8221; rise from their groveling attitude and a
fresh dance begins. But this time it is not confined
to the clearing. It is one which launches them into
the midst of the audience. Hither and thither they
caper, and from their tracks emerge a number of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
very young men. It might be that this is the
&#8220;Dance of Selection,&#8221; for it undoubtedly has the result
of bringing forth a number of striplings from
the ranks of the onlookers.</p>
<p>The dancers have made the complete circuit, and
about one hundred young men, little more than boys,
join in the great Sun-dance.</p>
<p>Now ensues one of the most terrible scenes of
human barbarity conceivable. In the course of the
dance the &#8220;med&#8217;cine&#8221; men seize upon each of the
willing victims in turn. On the breast of each boy
incisions are made with long, keen knives; two
parallel incisions on each side of the chest. The
flesh between each two of these is then literally torn
from the underlying tissues, and a rough stick is
thrust through the gaping wounds. So the would-be
brave is spitted.</p>
<p>Now a rawhide rope is attached to the centre of
the stick, the end of it is thrown over the gnarled
limb of one of the trees in the centre of the clearing,
and the youth is lifted from the ground and remains
suspended, the whole weight of his body borne by
the two straps of bloody flesh cut from his chest.</p>
<p>The dance proceeds until each youth is spitted
and suspended from the central cluster of trees, then,
with one accord, the men of the audience break
from their places and join in the war-dance. They
dance about the victims with a fierce glee like hundreds
of fiends; they beat them, they slash them
with knives, they thrust lighted brands upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
fresh young flesh till it blisters and throws out
nauseous odors. Their acts are acts of diabolical
torture, inconceivably savage. But the worst agony
is endured in desperate silence by each victim. That
is, by all but one.</p>
<p>Out of all the number hanging like dead men
upon the trees only one youth finds the torture unendurable.</p>
<p>He cries aloud for mercy, and his shrieks rise high
above the pandemonium going on about him.</p>
<p>Instantly he is cut down, the stick is removed
from his body, and he is driven from the ceremony
by the waiting squaws, amidst a storm of feminine
vituperation. He is the only one whose heart is
faint. He will never be permitted to fight. He
must live with the squaws all his days. He is considered
a squaw-man, the greatest indignity that can
be put upon him.</p>
<p>Thus are the braves made.</p>
<p>While the Sun-dance was still at its height two
men who had taken no part in it, except that of secret
spectators, moved quickly and silently away through
the forest. Their gait was almost a flight, but not
of fear.</p>
<p>Ten minutes of half running and half walking
brought them to a spot where two horses were tethered
under the guardianship of the fierce General.
Here they mounted, and, without a word, proceeded
with all speed in the direction of the Agency.</p>
<p>At the door they halted, and Seth spoke for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
first time since leaving the Sun-dance. Parker had
already dismounted, but the other remained in his
saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you&#8217;ll move right off,&#8221; he said quickly, &#8220;an&#8217;
git Hargreaves an&#8217; his wimminfolk clear, too. Guess
you&#8217;ll make the farm &#8217;fore me, sure. Take the bridge
for it. Rosebud &#8217;ll let you in. Guess you&#8217;ll find
plenty o&#8217; company &#8217;fore daylight. Rosie &#8217;ll see to
the signals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Parker nodded. &#8220;They&#8217;re moving to-night.
This is a carefully planned surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth glanced at the eastern sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Four hours to daylight,&#8221; he mused. Then:
&#8220;Yes, guess there&#8217;s more&#8217;n Black Fox&#8217;s hand in this.
So long.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rode off with his faithful dog at his heels, making
for the ford, and watchful of every shadow as he
went. His night&#8217;s work was yet only half done.</p>
<p>Crossing the river he climbed the opposite bank
and rode out upon the prairie. Making a wide
detour he came to within a hundred yards of the
front of Nevil Steyne&#8217;s hut. Here he halted and dismounted.
Crouching upon the ground he scanned
the sky-line carefully in every direction. At last he
seemed satisfied, and, flinging his bridle reins to the
dog, who promptly took them in his powerful jaws
and quietly sat down in front of the horse&#8217;s head,
moved cautiously forward.</p>
<p>In a few moments he came upon two horses standing
asleep, tethered by long ropes to picket-pins.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
One of these he released and led back to his own.
Then he remounted and rode on. Again he circled
wide of his destination, and this time struck into the
woods that lined the river. His way now lay down
the black aisles of tree trunks which he pursued until
he came to a spot he was evidently in search of.
Then he again dismounted, and, entrusting the two
horses to the dog&#8217;s care, moved forward on foot.</p>
<p>With unerring judgment he broke cover directly
in rear of Nevil&#8217;s log hut. There was neither window
nor door on this side, a fact which he was evidently
aware of, for, without hesitation, but with
movements as silent as any Indian, he crept round
to the front, and sidled to the window. Here there
was a light shining dully, but no means of obtaining
a view of the interior. He moved on, and, crouching
at the doorway, listened intently. A few seconds
satisfied him. Wanaha was inside; she was awake,
for he heard her moving about. He knew at once
that Nevil was out.</p>
<p>With a satisfied sigh he moved away. This time
he walked eastward toward the bridge, keeping close
in the shadow of the woods. A couple of hundred
yards from the hut he stopped and took up a position
just within the shelter of the undergrowth,
whence he had a perfect view of the open plain in
front, and yet was sufficiently sheltered by the echoing
woods to hear the least movement of any one
passing that way. And so he waited.</p>
<p>Nor did he wait long. Eyes and ears trained to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
this sort of work were kept ever on the alert. But
it was his ears which told him at last of some one
approaching. Some one was moving through the
woods. The sound was faint and distant, but he
heard it. There was no mistake. And he knew it
was Nevil Steyne returning home.</p>
<p>Clearing the brush he made his way into the midst
of the aisles of leafless tree-trunks. Pausing in the
shadow of one of the forest giants he waited. The
footsteps came nearer. He shifted his position again;
for his ears told him that he was not yet on the track
which Nevil would take.</p>
<p>At last, however, he came to a stand, and did not
move again. Guided by a wonderful hearing, he
knew that he was in a direct line between the man
approaching and his home.</p>
<p>He leant against a tree, his eyes and ears straining.
Some few yards away there was a shaft of moonlight
stretching right across the path which Nevil must
take, and on this path Seth kept his eyes.</p>
<p>The man came on all unconscious of who and what
was awaiting him. He had no thought of his presence
at the Sun-dance having been detected. His
thoughts were on what the morrow was to bring
forth; on what it would mean to him when Rosebud
was removed from his path. She alone stood between
him and that which he had schemed for ever
since the arrival of the memorable letter from his
brother. He was in a mood of intense satisfaction.
He knew that at last he was to realize his desires,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
that at last he was to pay off a long score which he
owed Seth of White River Farm.</p>
<p>He stepped into the moonlit patch. The sudden
flash of light made him pause. It startled him. He
looked beyond apprehensively, then he looked up,
and the great moon above reassured him. He moved
on. The next moment he stopped dead. He could
proceed no further. A ring of metal was pressing
against his forehead, and Seth was behind it, and his
smooth, even voice, coldly compelling, held him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, I&#8217;ve been lookin&#8217; fer you,&#8221; it said. &#8220;You&#8217;re
comin&#8217; right up to the farm. The Injuns are out.
Savee? Jest fer once you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to work on our
side. Say, you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to fight &#8217;em&mdash;with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a deathly silence. Neither moved.
The gun was pressing the man&#8217;s forehead still.
Nevil stood like one paralyzed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal?&#8221; questioned the cold voice, proceeding
from Seth&#8217;s shadowy figure.</p>
<p>And Nevil was driven to speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a fighting man. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But his denial was cut short.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve jest got ten seconds to make up your
mind. You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to fight&mdash;for us, or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth had in no way raised his tones from the cold
level of his manner at the beginning. His victim
had only a shadowy impression of him. He saw
only a hazy outline in the blackness of the forest;
and he needed no further sight to convince him.
There was sufficient in the tone, and in the pressure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
of the gun at his head. He knew the rest. Here
was a sudden collapse of all his schemes. There
could be no resistance. Seth had the drop on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; he said sullenly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>IN DESPERATE PLIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>At daylight the truth was known. The greatest
Indian rising of two decades had begun.</p>
<p>The Bad-Lands had entered upon a period of
slaughter, of wanton massacre, which was to form
one of the bloodiest pages in the history of Indian
warfare.</p>
<p>The first to realize the full terror of the situation
were the troops in the small trader&#8217;s fort overlooking
the Reservations. They awoke to find themselves
hemmed in by a vast army of red-skinned warriors,
entirely cut off from the outside world. The climax of
their discovery was reached when an attempt was
made to dispatch a telegraphic message to headquarters.
The wire was cut.</p>
<p>The next to grasp the situation were the citizens
of Beacon Crossing. The railroad track was destroyed,
and all telegraphic communication was cut
off. A horde of warriors from Pine Ridge Reservation,
some thousands strong, threatened the township
from the east, thus cutting them off from the
settlers on the plains.</p>
<p>The full knowledge of these things came in driblets
to the refugees gathering at White River Farm, filtering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
through piece by piece as each party came in.
But as yet not an Indian had shown himself in the
vicinity of the farm. Already twelve families had
sought the shelter of Rube&#8217;s stockade. And all was
in readiness for the siege.</p>
<p>The morning passed, and still two families lying
farther out than all the others had not yet arrived.
It was an anxious waiting.</p>
<p>It was three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon when at last
one of the missing parties appeared on the horizon.
It was at once seen that the two vehicles were being
driven at a desperate pace. They were approaching
from the north, and even at that distance the
lookout could see the drivers flogging their horses
into a furious gallop.</p>
<p>Seth passed the order to stand by. The defenders
responded, and the stockade immediately bristled
with rifles.</p>
<p>The wagons came on. Then suddenly a small
party of Indians appeared over the horizon, racing
in hot pursuit. But evidently the view of the farm
altered their plans, for they reined in, halted, and, a
moment later, wheeling about, vanished whence they
came.</p>
<p>Seth, watching from the top of the stockade, realized
something of the significance of their movements.
And far graver fears than the man&oelig;uvre seemed
to warrant assailed him.</p>
<p>The late arrivals brought further bad tidings.
The Indians on the Cheyenne River Reservation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
were out, and working in concert with the others.
It is a bad business when Indian tribes band together
against a common foe. There was consternation
among the women when they heard the news. The
men smiled grimly, but there was no lightness in
their hearts.</p>
<p>The time of waiting dragged wearily. Every one
within the stockade felt the suspense to be far worse
than the fiercest fighting. The intangible threat of
this unnatural calm was dreadful. Still, the respite
was not without its uses. Defences were strengthened
with earthworks hastily thrown up on the inside of
the stockade, and the upper rooms of the house were
made ready for a selected firing party, whilst the
women made every preparation for the comfort of
their men.</p>
<p>Nevil Steyne moved about bearing his share in the
labors. He was morosely silent, and his presence
caused much speculation amongst those who knew
nothing of what had happened on the previous night.
Seth&#8217;s replies when questioned on the subject were
evasive. Rube and Parker were no wiser than the
rest, except that Seth had told them that Nevil was
his prisoner, and must on no account be allowed to
escape.</p>
<p>The gray spring twilight had settled over the
plains. Still the last family, Joe Smith and his belongings,
had not come in. Seth intended to give
them their chance up to the very last, before he finally
closed the gates. As the sun dropped he dispatched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
four mounted men to act as vedettes. They took
up their positions a mile out from the farm, with
orders to fire two shots in quick succession on sight
of any Indians, and then to ride in with all speed.</p>
<p>After delivering his instructions he took up his
position upon the stockade and watched them go.
He was very anxious for the safety of Joe Smith;
his place was nearly ten miles out, and away to the
northeast. He knew that if the northern Indians
were out it was quite possible that the old man had
been cut off.</p>
<p>Now, as the day drew to a close, something of the
gloomy prospect before them all seemed to have entered
his soul. He was no alarmist, but he knew
only too well the meaning of a big general Indian
rising. The horrors he had witnessed in his early
days were strong upon him, and the presence of all
these white women under his charge weighed sorely.
Nor did he glean much satisfaction from the thought
that, at least, should disaster fall upon them he still
had power to punish the man whom he knew to be
the author of all this trouble. It would be poor consolation.</p>
<p>The darkness was growing. Now the reflection of
Indian fires could be seen in almost every direction.
There seemed to be a perfect ring of them, in the
distance, around the farm.</p>
<p>He was disturbed in his gloomy reverie by the
sound of some one scrambling up the newly-made
earthworks to his side. It was Rosebud.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>
<p>She took her seat at his side in silence. She was
clad in her old prairie riding-habit of canvas, strong
and rough, and eminently suited to the present condition
of things. They had hardly met since the first
alarm, so busy had everybody been. But now that
all was ready the final lull before the breaking of the
storm had provided even the busiest with leisure.
The girl&#8217;s first words came abruptly, and displayed
her wonderful faith in the man to whom they all
looked for help and protection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we pull through, Seth?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say, Rosie.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s reply was spoken slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor auntie!&#8221; Rosebud went on. &#8220;I can&#8217;t help
thinking of her. I wish I&#8217;d never said anything
about &#8217;scalping&#8217; to her. But she&#8217;s very good and
brave. She hasn&#8217;t complained, and she&#8217;s worked as
hard as anybody. Do you know, I believe, now
she&#8217;s got over the first shock of it, she rather enjoys
it. What do you think she said to me half an hour
ago? She said, with such a smile, &#8216;When I get
home I shall have something to tell them. I&#8217;m keeping
a diary.&#8217; Like a fool I said, &#8216;You aren&#8217;t home
yet, auntie.&#8217; I said it without thinking. What do
you suppose she replied?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll get home all right. Mr. Seth &#8217;ll see to
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Seth was impervious to the compliment. The
girl smilingly watched his sombre face out of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
corners of her eyes. There was no responsive
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s jest them things make it hard,&#8221; he said, with
something very like a sigh.</p>
<p>Rosebud&#8217;s face had become serious. Her thoughts
were hard at work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it as bad as that?&#8221; she asked presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t no use lookin&#8217; at it easy. We&#8217;re facin&#8217;
the music&mdash;hard&mdash;this time. But we ain&#8217;t done yet.
Not by a sight. It&#8217;s kind o&#8217; lucky we&#8217;ve laid in a
big store of ammunition an&#8217; things.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was dark by now, except for the glow of Indian
fires, which gave a weird light on all sides.</p>
<p>Rosebud drew closer to the man&#8217;s side. Her
action passed unnoticed. His eyes were intent upon
the dark horizon. He was watching, watching, with
every faculty alert. He was listening, his ears ready
to catch the faintest sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be all right if only they could have
sent word to the headquarters of the troops, I s&#8217;pose,&#8221;
the girl said thoughtfully. &#8220;Just fancy the Indians
cutting the telegraph wires and destroying the railway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yup. Guess they&#8217;ve had all winter to get
things settled,&#8221; Seth responded indifferently, while
he turned a keen ear to windward.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you listening for?&#8221; asked Rosebud,
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;General&#8217;s out scoutin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good old General!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;ll locate the Injuns when they git
around.&#8221;</p>
<p>But just then Rosebud was thinking of other
things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you find some one who will try to
get through to the troops? I mean the headquarters?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t spare a single man,&#8221; he said conclusively.
&#8220;I &#8217;lows no white folk &#8217;ud get through anyways.
An&#8217; we ain&#8217;t got an Injun, an&#8217; if we had I wouldn&#8217;t
trust him no more&#8217;n I&#8217;d trust a &#8217;rattler.&#8217; No, Rosie,
gal, we&#8217;ve got to fight this out on our own. An&#8217;
make no sort o&#8217; mistake we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to fight good
an&#8217; hard. I&#8217;ve figgered to hold this place fer two
weeks an&#8217; more. That&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve figgered.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the final repetition which filled Rosebud
with misgivings. She realized the man&#8217;s doubt.
Suddenly she slipped a hand through his arm, and
it gently closed over one of his. Her soft eyes were
raised to his face as she put another question in a
low tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if we go under, Seth?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man moved uneasily, but the little hand retained
its hold of his.</p>
<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth cleared his throat, but remained silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221; the girl persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought once or twice of my poor father and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
mother,&#8221; Rosebud said presently. &#8220;I was wondering
what happened to them at&mdash;at the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth eyed the girl for a second. His face was
troubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a notion he was killed by the Injuns,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t jest say. I don&#8217;t fancy, though, he let the
brutes worrit her any.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was another pause. With an involuntary
movement Rosebud&#8217;s hand tightened trustfully upon
his.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think father was right&mdash;to do that,&#8221; she said
simply.</p>
<p>The man nodded.</p>
<p>The next moment he was kneeling, his body bending
forward, and his eyes straining in the direction
of the horizon.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; the girl asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217;s something movin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Rosebud could hear nothing. Still she was
content to accept his assurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wheels,&#8221; he said after a few moments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it Joe Smith&#8217;s outfit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yup.&#8221;</p>
<p>They both listened. The girl could now hear the
faintest possible rattle of wheels. Suddenly she
turned upon him. Her breath was coming quickly.
She was smiling, and her eyes were soft under cover
of the dim starlight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Seth, I want you to let me do something. In the
old days you used to be my dear old &#8217;daddy.&#8217; You
used to scold me when I did wrong. You used to
get angry with me, and I used to get more angry
with you. Since I&#8217;ve grown up, of course, things
have changed, haven&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The man looked into her face wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, daddy dear,&#8221; the girl laughed nervously.
&#8220;Maybe when the trouble begins I shan&#8217;t see much
of you. You&#8217;ll be busy, and so will I. It&#8217;s peace
now, and I just want you to fall back into the old
way. I want you for my &#8216;daddy&#8217;&mdash;my dear, dear
old &#8216;daddy&#8217;&mdash;just for these few minutes. I want to
be the silly scatterbrain I used to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t a heap at guessin&#8217;, Rosie,&#8221; Seth said
doubtfully, but smiling tenderly at the upturned face.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you never were.&#8221; Rosebud gave a queer
little laugh. &#8220;Well, I just want you to let me ride
out and meet dear old Mrs. Smith. You know what
a nervous old dear she is. I just thought if I rode
out it might brighten her up. You see, she&#8217;d think
the danger less, if a woman came to meet her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I won&#8217;t say you no, gal,&#8221; Seth replied
gravely. &#8220;Guess it ain&#8217;t right. But ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t a
heap of danger. Y&#8217; see in them old days I most
gener&#8217;ly let you do as you notioned,&#8221; he finished up
with a shadowy smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear old daddy!&#8221; Rosebud squeezed his arm
with both her hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217; be off, an&#8217; git your plug saddled, or mebbe
I&#8217;ll change my mind.&#8221; The man could stand the
temptation no longer. He gently released himself,
and the girl moved as though to descend. But she
altered her mind. Fortunately neither could see the
other&#8217;s face distinctly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth,&#8221; she said, with forced brightness, &#8220;in the
old days when I asked your permission for anything
and you gave it to me you&mdash;you didn&#8217;t let me go
like that. It was customary for me to show my
gratitude&mdash;like&mdash;like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>She suddenly leant forward and imprinted a swift
kiss on the man&#8217;s thin cheek. And before he could
reply, or even move, she had clambered down from
the wall and made off. Nor was it until he heard
her horse galloping out of the stockade, which occurred
suspiciously soon after her leaving him, that
he became aware that his cheek was wet with tears
that had not been of his shedding.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>A LAST ADVENTURE</h3>
</div>

<p>It was not without a guilty feeling that Rosebud
rode out of the stockade. She knew that she was deceiving
Seth. She knew that she had lied to him deliberately.
Worse, she had played upon his feelings
with intent to deceive him. But her motive was
good, and she tried to draw consolation from the
knowledge.</p>
<p>Her argument was worthy of her. It was impulsive,
and would not stand the test of logical inspection.
She had thought long before putting her
plan into execution; at least, long for her. She
told herself that no deceit was unpardonable which
had an honest, sound motive. In fact it was not deceit
at all, only subterfuge.</p>
<p>Her argument was something after this fashion.
She had been the chief source of trouble. Therefore
she owed something to the general welfare. Seth
was harassed with his responsibilities, and the chances
were terribly against him and those under his charge.
There was something she could do, something which
might turn the tide in their favor, might save the
situation. What if to carry it out she must act a lie?
Who would blame her if she were successful? If it
failed it would not matter to her who blamed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>She was a child no longer, but a strong woman
whose devotion to those she loved rose boundless
over every other feeling. It was this very devotion
that urged her and shut out every scruple, every
qualm of conscience, at the manner in which she had
gained her ends.</p>
<p>Thus she passed out into the dark, starlit world,
with its strange glare of fire.</p>
<p>Once clear of the farm she heaved a deep sigh.
The tension had relaxed now that she felt herself to
be doing at last. Cooped within the stockade, her
plans still waiting to be set in motion, she had felt
nigh to choking with nervousness. Her anxiety to
be gone had been overwhelming. Perhaps none
knew better than she what the task of cajoling Seth
meant, for he was not an easy man when duty was
uppermost in his mind. But that was all done with
now; she was out at last.</p>
<p>The freedom of her horse&#8217;s gait felt good under
her. There was confidence, exhilaration to be drawn
from each springing stride. And, too, there was a
new and delightful sense of responsibility in the
heavy lolling of the revolver holsters upon her hips.
But above all there was the supreme feeling that she
was endeavoring to help those she had left behind.</p>
<p>Her tears had dried before she mounted to the back
of the animal to which she was now pinning her faith.
The parting kiss she had imprinted upon the man&#8217;s
thin cheek had inspired her. Life meant nothing to
her without him. Her fortune was nothing to her,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
no one was anything to her compared with him. He
stood out over everything else in her thoughts.</p>
<p>She heard the rumbling of the wheels of Joe
Smith&#8217;s wagons, but gave no heed to them. Instead,
she rode straight on to the south, purposely
avoiding the newcomers she was ostensibly going
to meet. In a few minutes she drew rein at Wanaha&#8217;s
log hut.</p>
<p>She was not without some doubts when she saw
that the place was in darkness. But her apprehensions
were quickly dissipated. Her first summons
brought the squaw to the door, where her tall, dark
figure stood out in the gentle starlight.</p>
<p>As was her custom Rosebud handed the woman
the reins to hook upon the wall. She was constrained
to do without her usual greeting, for she knew that,
here too, she must deceive to gain her ends. It
would be madness to tell the half-tamed savage her
real intentions. Wanaha&#8217;s love for her was great,
but well she knew that blood is thicker than water,
and a savage&#8217;s blood more particularly so than anybody&#8217;s
else.</p>
<p>Once inside the hut Wanaha was the first to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;You come? On this night?&#8221; she questioned,
choosing her English words with her usual care.</p>
<p>The girl permitted no unnecessary delay in plunging
into the object of her visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, my Wana,&#8221; she replied, drawing the
tall woman to her, so that, in the dim starlight, they
sat together on the edge of the bed. Her action was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
one of tender affection. Wanaha submitted, well
pleased that her white friend had allowed nothing of
the doings of her people to come between them.
&#8220;Yes, I come to you for help. I come to you because
I want to remove the cause of all the trouble
between your people and mine. Do you know the
source of the trouble? I&#8217;ll tell you. I am!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud looked fixedly in the great dark eyes,
so soft yet so radiant in the starlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. It is&mdash;my brother. He want you. He
fight for you. Kill, slay. It matter not so he have
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman nodded gravely. The girl&#8217;s heart
bounded, for she saw that her task was to be an
easy one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, so it is. I have thought much about this
thing. I should never have come back to the farm.
It was bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Wanaha nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is why I come to you. I love my
friends. There is some one I love, like you love
your Nevil, and I want to save him. They will all
be killed if I stay, for your brother is mighty&mdash;a
great warrior. So I am going away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud&#8217;s allusion to the squaw&#8217;s love for her
husband was tactful. She was completely won.
The girl, who was clasping one of Wanaha&#8217;s hands,
felt a warm, responsive pressure of sympathy, and
she knew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, now I want you to help me,&#8221; she hurried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
on. &#8220;To go as I am now, a white girl in white girl&#8217;s
clothing, would be madness. I know your people.
I should never escape their all-seeing eyes. I must
go like one of your people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would be&mdash;a squaw?&#8221; A wonderful smile
was in the great black eyes as Wanaha put the
question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I see. Wana sees.&#8221; A rising excitement
seemed to stir the squaw. She came closer to her
white friend and spoke quickly, stumbling over her
English in a manner she would never have permitted
in cooler moments. &#8220;An&#8217; in these way you mak&#8217;
yourself go. You fly, you run; so my brother, the
great chief, no more you find. Yes? Then him
say, &#8217;him gone.&#8217; We no more use him fight. We
go by tepee quick. An&#8217; there is great peace. Is
that how?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is it,&#8221; cried Rosebud, in her eagerness
flinging her arms about the squaw&#8217;s neck. &#8220;We
must be quick. Seth will miss me from the farm, and
then there&#8217;ll be a to-do, and he will come hunting
for me. Lend me your clothes, a blanket, and an
Indian saddle. Quick, my Wana! you&#8217;ll help me,
won&#8217;t you? Oh, make haste and say, and set my
doubts at rest!&#8221;</p>
<p>The tide of the girl&#8217;s appeal had its effect. The
squaw rose swiftly, silently. She moved off and
presently came back with a bundle of beaded buckskin
clothing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You wear these, they my own. I get him for
you. See. You put on, I go get saddle. The blanket
here. So. Nevil, my Nevil, from home. Wana
not know where. But maybe he come quick an&#8217; find
you an&#8217; then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Wana did not finish expressing her fears. She
seemed suddenly to remember of whom she was
speaking, and that there was disloyalty in what she
was saying.</p>
<p>But Rosebud was paying little heed. She was already
changing her clothes. She knew the value of
time just then, and she had been forced to waste
much already. While she was completing the transformation,
the squaw went out and changed her saddle
and bridle for an Indian blanket and surcingle
with stirrups attached to it, and a plaited, gaudy rope
bridle and spade bit.</p>
<p>When she came back the white girl had completed
her toilet, even to the moccasins and buckskin chapps.
Even the undemonstrative Wanaha exclaimed at the
metamorphosis.</p>
<p>She saw before her in the dim starlight the most
delightful picture of a squaw. Rosebud&#8217;s wealth of
golden hair was hidden beneath the folds of the colored
blanket, and only her fair white face with its
dazzling eyes, bright now with excitement, shone
out and destroyed the illusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are much beautiful,&#8221; the Indian declared in
amazement. Then she stood gazing until Rosebud&#8217;s
practical voice roused her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Food, my Wana.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I give bread and meat. It in bags on the horse.
So. Now you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear Wana. I must go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud reached her arms up to the tall woman&#8217;s
neck, and drawing her dark face down to her own,
kissed her. Though she loved this dark princess
she knew that her kiss was the kiss of Judas. Then
she passed out, and, mounting her horse, rode
away.</p>
<p>Within five minutes of her going, and while Wanaha
was still standing in the doorway looking after
her, a party of warriors, headed by Little Black Fox
himself, rode up to the house. The chief had come
in search of Nevil Steyne. He angrily demanded
the white man&#8217;s whereabouts of the woman who was
his sister.</p>
<p>The ensuing scene was one of ferocious rage on
the part of the headstrong man, and fear, hidden
under an exterior of calm debate, on the part of
Wanaha. She knew her brother, and in her mind
tried to account for her husband&#8217;s absence. After
the warriors had departed she passed a night of
gloomy foreboding.</p>
<p>All unconscious of her narrow escape, Rosebud
headed away to the northeast. She had no elaborate
scheme of route. With the instinct of her prairie
training she knew her direction. She would make
her destination as the crow flies, chancing everything,
every danger, so that she could make the best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
time; no personal considerations entered into her
calculations.</p>
<p>She could see the reflections of the camp-fires in
the sky in every direction, but, with a reckless courage,
she cared nothing for this. A more calculating
mind might well have shrunk from the dangers they
suggested. To her they meant no more than obstacles
which must be confronted and overcome. She
knew nothing of strategy in warfare; of cover there
was none in the direction she was taking.</p>
<p>Like the line of great soldiers from whom she was
descended she understood riding straight only. Let
the fences and pitfalls come, let them be what they
might, she would not swerve. Whatever the emergency,
she was prepared to confront it, and, like a
thorough sportswoman but a bad general, to take
her chance, relying only on her good horse and the
darkness, and the proverbial luck of the reckless.</p>
<p>Though this was her general idea she did all she
could to help. A featherweight, she still strove to
ride lighter. Then she had her firearms, and she
steeled her heart to their use. After all she came
from splendid fighting stock.</p>
<p>She allowed herself no thought of failure. She
must not fail, she told herself. They were waiting
for help in the stockade behind her; patient, strong,
a man of lion heart, who knew defeat only when the
last shot was fired, the last blow struck, and he was
left helpless to defend himself and those others, he
was waiting. Her thoughts inspired her with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
courage of a brave woman whose lover is in grave
peril, than which there is no greater courage in the
world.</p>
<p>Now the moment of her peril drew near. Every
raking stride of her willing horse cut the brief seconds
shorter and shorter. The lurid reflections of
the camp-fires in the sky had given place to the starlike
glow of the fires themselves, and every yard of
the distance covered showed them larger and plainer
against the sky-line.</p>
<p>She was riding straight for the middle course of
the black space dividing two of the fires ahead.
There was little to choose in any direction, so complete
was the circle around the farm, but she had
been quick to see that that little lay here.</p>
<p>She measured the distance she had to go with her
eye. It was not far, and instinctively she reined her
horse up to give him breathing for the great effort to
come; an effort which she knew was to be very real
indeed. Approaching steadily she made her preparations.
Freeing her right arm from her blanket
she drew one of her revolvers and saw that it was
fully loaded. Then she closely scrutinized the fires.
She could make out the general outline of two vast
camps away to the right and left of her. The fires
were in the midst, and right to the limits of the lurid
light, she could see the dim outlines of innumerable
tepees, and crowds of moving figures. It was a
sight to put fear into the heart of a daring man, then
how much more so into the heart of a frail woman?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></p>
<p>The black stretch before her seemed devoid of
tepees, but she was not sure. Of one thing she felt
convinced, even if the camps were confined to the
fires there was no likelihood of these wide intervals
being left unguarded.</p>
<p>Her horse refreshed, she put him into a strong
gallop, and in a few minutes had entered the danger
zone. Almost on the instant her surmise proved
correct. The air directly ahead of her split with a
fierce yell. She knew it. It was the Sioux war-cry.
The supreme moment had come. It must be now or
never. Clinching her moccasined heels into her
horse&#8217;s barrel she sent him racing headlong. And
as he rushed forward she gripped her revolver ready
for immediate use.</p>
<p>An Indian mounted on a pony suddenly loomed
ahead of her. Such was her pace that he seemed to
rush out of the darkness upon her. Yet his pony had
not moved. There was a clatter of speeding hoofs on
either side, and she knew that the alarm had been
taken up, and the bloodthirsty warriors from the
camps were in pursuit.</p>
<p>The man ahead appeared only for an instant. Her
revolver was covering him, the terrific speed of her
horse helped her aim. She saw the sights of her
weapon; she saw the man. The hammer fell. There
was a cry, and the biting report of the revolver died
away in the darkness. She had passed the spot
where the man had been. Horse and rider had
vanished. She had no thought for anything now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
She was conscious of only one thing, the din of pursuit.</p>
<p>Thrusting the revolver back into its holster she
offered up a silent prayer to heaven. Then she
leaned over her horse&#8217;s neck to relieve him of her
weight, and, with the yelling horde hard upon her
heels, gave herself up to the race.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>HARD PRESSED</h3>
</div>

<p>During those first terrible days of the Indian outbreak
the horrors that befell could only be guessed
at. The government, the people living without the
danger zone, gradually learned the full details, but
those most concerned only knew what was happening
in their immediate neighborhood. Every one,
even those who had made a life-study of their red-skinned
neighbors, were taken unawares. The
methods of the untried chieftain had proved themselves
absolutely Napoleonic.</p>
<p>There could be no doubt that the whole campaign
was the result of long and secret preparation.
But it had been put into execution at the psychological
moment, which was its warrant of success.
That this moment had been unpremeditated, and that
something very like chance alone had precipitated
matters, afforded neither hope nor consolation.</p>
<p>And this chance. A frail white woman; Rosebud&#8217;s
return to the farm&mdash;her visit in Nevil Steyne&#8217;s company
to the Reservation. For a few moments the
wild, haughty chieftain had stood observing her as
she rode through the encampment; and in those few
moments the mischief was done.</p>
<p>The old trading fort offered little resistance to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
Indian attack, and the handful of troops within it
very little more. Being soldiers they were treated
to the Indians&#8217; first attention. An overwhelming
horde of picked warriors was sent to deal with them,
and, by the end of the second day, the massacre and
sacking of the post were accomplished.</p>
<p>In this way a large reinforcement was added to the
party threatening Beacon Crossing. Intoxicated with
their first success the whole army rushed upon the
unfortunate township. And all the more fierce was
the onslaught for the reason that the attack was made
up of rival tribes.</p>
<p>The Rosebuds had wiped out the troops, and, in
consequence, the men of Pine Ridge, fired by jealousy,
advanced like a raging torrent mad with the
desire for slaughter. Utterly unprepared for such
rapid movements, the men at the Crossing, unorganized,
hardly realizing what had happened, fell easy
victims.</p>
<p>The township, like the fort, was wiped from the
fair face of the budding prairie-land. The horrors
of the massacre were too terrible to be dealt with
here. Every man, woman, and child now living in
the country has heard the tales of that awful week.
Few people escaped, and those only by taking to the
Black Hills, where they suffered untold privations
from want and exposure.</p>
<p>Having thus disposed of the two principal centres
from which interference might spring, the Indians
proceeded to devote themselves to the individual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
settlers upon the prairie. Not a farm escaped their
attention. North and south, east and west, for miles
and miles the red tide swept over the face of the
plains, burning, sacking, murdering.</p>
<p>A track of blood was left behind them wherever
they went. Charred monuments marked the tombs
of hardy settlers caught in the red flood; where peace
and prosperity had so recently reigned, now were
only ruin and devastation.</p>
<p>With each succeeding day the horror grew. The
northern Indians threw in their lot with their warlike
Sioux brothers, and all the smaller and more
distant tribes, numerically too weak for initiative,
hastened to the bloody field of battle. The rebellion
grew; it spread over the country like a running sore.
The Bad Lands were maintaining their title.</p>
<p>At first the news that filtered through to the outside
world was meagre, and devoid of reliable detail.
Thus it happened that only a few troops were hurried
to the scene of action. It was not until these,
like the handful at the fort, had served to swell the
roll of massacre, and the fact became known that the
northern posts, where large forces were always kept
in readiness, were cut off from all communications,
that the world learned the full horror that had befallen
the Indian territory of Dakota.</p>
<p>Through these days the one place to hold out
against the fierce onslaught of an overwhelming foe
was the fortified farm of White River. But it was
in a desperate plight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span></p>
<p>So far only the foresight of the defenders had
saved them. The vast strength of the stockade and
the inner earthworks, hurriedly thrown up at the last
moment, and the unswerving devotion of the little
band of settlers within its shelter, had formed a combination
of stout resistance. But as the time passed,
and each day brought with it its tally of casualties,
the position became more and more desperate.</p>
<p>With each attack the fortifications suffered. Twice
the ramparts were breached, and only nightfall had
saved the situation. At long range fighting the white
defenders had the best of it, but hand to hand the
issue was reversed. Each day saw one or two of
the white men laid low, and the burden of the rest
proportionately increased. Thus, out of a total of
thirty available men and youths, at the end of six
days the force was reduced by nearly a third.</p>
<p>But worst of all was the strain. Every man within
the stockade, and for that matter, most of the women,
too, knew that the pressure could not endure much
longer without disastrous results. Ammunition was
plentiful, provisions also, and the well supplied all
the water necessary. It was none of these; it was
the nerve strain, the lack of proper rest and sleep.
The men only snatched odd half hours in the daytime.
At night every eye and ear had to be alert.</p>
<p>Seth and Parker headed everything. In the councils
they were the leaders, just as they were in the
fighting. And on them devolved the full control of
affairs, from the distribution of rations, in which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
Ma Sampson and Miss Parker were their lieutenants,
to the regulations for the sanitation of the fort.</p>
<p>All the time Nevil Steyne was never lost sight of.
He was driven to fight beside his leader with Rube
close behind him ready for any treachery. He knew
that Seth knew him, knew his secret, knew his relations
with the Indians, and he quite understood that
his only hope lay in implicit obedience, and a watchful
eye for escape. His nature was such that he had
no qualms of conscience in regard to opposing his
red-skinned friends. That part he accepted philosophically.
He had so long played a game of self-seeking
treachery that his present condition came
quite easily to him.</p>
<p>For Seth, who shall say what that dreadful period
of suspense must have been? He went about his
work with his usual quiet, thoughtful face, a perfect
mask for that which lay behind it. There was no
change of manner or expression. Success or disaster
could not alter his stern, unyielding ways. He
fought with the abandon and desperation of any
Indian warrior when it came to close quarters, returning
to his quiet, alert manner of command the moment
the fighting was over. He was uncomplaining,
always reassuring those about him, and carrying
in his quiet personality something that fired his
companions to exertions which no words of encouragement
could have done.</p>
<p>Yet he was passing through an agony of heart and
mind such as few men are submitted to. Rosebud
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
had gone, vanished, and no one could answer the
question that was forever in his mind. He had
looked for her return when Joe Smith&#8217;s party came
in, only to be confounded by the fact that she had
not even been seen by them. That night he had
risked everything for her. He scouted till dawn,
visiting Wanaha&#8217;s hut, but only to find it deserted.
Finally he returned to the farm, a broken-hearted
man, bitter with the reflection that he alone was to
blame for what had happened.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s loss cast a terrible gloom over the whole
fort. It was only her sense of responsibility which
saved Ma from breaking down altogether. Rube
said not a word, but, like Seth, he perhaps suffered
the more.</p>
<p>It was on the seventh day that a curious change
came over the situation. At first it was greeted with
delight, but after the novelty had passed, a grave
suspicion grew in the minds of the worn and weary
defenders. There was not a shot fired. The enemy
had withdrawn to their distant camps, and a heavy
peace prevailed. But the move was so unaccountable
that all sought the reason of it.</p>
<p>Counsel was taken by the heads of the defence,
and the feeling of uneasiness grew. The more experienced
conceived it to be the herald of a final,
overwhelming onslaught. The younger preferred
optimistic views, which they found unconvincing.
However, every one took care that advantage was
taken of the respite.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></p>
<p>Seth had his supper in one of the upper rooms in
company with Parker and Nevil Steyne. He sat at
the open window watching, watching with eyes
straining and nerves painfully alert. Others might
rest, he could not, dared not.</p>
<p>The sun dipped below the horizon. The brief
spring twilight changed from gold to gray. A footstep
sounded outside the door of the room where the
three men were sitting. A moment later Mrs. Rickards
came in. Rosebud&#8217;s cousin had changed considerably
in those seven days. Her ample proportions
were shrunken. Her face was less round, but
had gained in character. The education of a lifetime
had been crowded into the past week for her. And
it had roused a spirit within her bosom, the presence
of which she had not even suspected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rube wants you, Seth,&#8221; she announced. &#8220;He&#8217;s
on the north side of the stockade. It&#8217;s something
particular, I think,&#8221; she added. &#8220;That&#8217;s why he
asked me to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a few words of thanks, Seth accompanied
her from the room and moved down-stairs. It was
on their way down that Mrs. Rickards laid a hand,
already work-worn, upon the man&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re advancing again. Seth, shall we get
out of this trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question was asked without any expression of
fear, and the man knew that the woman wanted a
plain, truthful answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t seem like it,&#8221; he answered quietly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yet, I kind o&#8217; notion we shall.&#8221; Then after a pause
he asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s your work now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The wounded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Did you ever fire a gun, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a notion to try?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe it&#8217;s going to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can count on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wondering at the change in this Englishwoman,
her companion left her to join Rube.</p>
<p>He found the whole garrison agog with excitement
and alarm. There was a large gathering at
the north side of the stockade, behind the barn and
outbuildings. Even in the swift falling darkness it
was evident that a big move was going on in the
distant Indian camps. Nor did it take long to convince
everybody that the move was in the nature of
an advance.</p>
<p>After a long and earnest scrutiny through a pair of
old field-glasses, Seth, followed by Rube, made a round
of the fortifications. The movement was going on
in every direction, and he knew that by morning, at
any rate, they would have to confront a grand assault.
He had completed the round, and was in the
midst of discussing the necessary preparations with
Rube, still examining the outlook through the
glasses, when suddenly he broke off with a sharp
ejaculation. The next moment he turned to the old
man below him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Take these glasses, Rube,&#8221; he said rapidly, &#8220;an&#8217;
stay right here. Guess I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to drop over. I&#8217;ll
be back in awhiles. There&#8217;s somethin&#8217; movin&#8217; among
the grass within gunshot.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a cheery &#8220;aye,&#8221; Rube clambered to the top
of the stockade as the younger man disappeared on
the other side.</p>
<p>Seth landed on his hands and knees and moved
out in that manner. Whatever his quarry the plainsman&#8217;s
movements would have been difficult of detection,
for he crept along toward his goal with that
rapid, serpentine movement so essentially Indian.</p>
<p>Rube watched him until darkness hid him from
view. Then, stooping low, and scanning the sky-line
a few minutes later, he distinctly made out the
silhouette of two men standing talking together.</p>
<p>Seth found himself confronting an Indian. The
man was plastered with war-paint, and his befeathered
head was an imposing sight. But, even in the
darkness, he recognized the broad face and slit-like
eyes of the scout, Jim Crow. He was fully armed,
but the white man&#8217;s gun held him covered. In response
to the summons of the threatening weapon,
the man laid his arms upon the ground. Then he
stood erect, and, grinning in his habitual manner,
he waved an arm in the direction of the moving
Indians.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal?&#8221; inquired Seth, coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I, Jim Crow, come. I know heap. Fi&#8217; dollar an&#8217;
I say.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></p>
<p>Seth thought rapidly. And the result was another
sharp inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fi&#8217; dollar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s worth it, sure, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It heap worth,&#8221; replied the scout readily.</p>
<p>Seth&#8217;s comment was short.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a durned scoundrel anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jim Crow was quite unabashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, it this,&#8221; he said, and for the moment his
face had ceased to grin. &#8220;I see much. I learn
much. See.&#8221; He waved an arm, comprehensively
taking in the whole countryside. &#8220;White men all
dead&mdash;all kill. Beacon&mdash;it gone. Fort&mdash;it gone.
Farm&mdash;all gone. So. Miles an&#8217; miles. They all
kill. Soldiers, come by south. They, too, all kill.
Indian man everywhere. So. To-morrow they eat
up dis farm. So. They kill all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal?&#8221; Seth seemed quite unconcerned by the
man&#8217;s graphic picture.</p>
<p>At once Jim Crow assumed a look of cunning.
His eyes became narrower slits than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;So. It dis way,&#8221; he said, holding up a hand and
indicating each finger as he proceeded to make his
points. &#8220;Black Fox&mdash;him angry. Much. Big soldier
men come from north. They fight&mdash;very fierce,
an&#8217; tousands of &#8217;em. They drive Indian back, back.
Indian man everywhere kill. So. They come.
Chief him much angry. Him say, &#8216;They come.
But I kill all white men first.&#8217; So to-morrow he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
burn the farm right up, an&#8217; kill everybody much
dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the soldiers are near?&#8221;</p>
<p>The white man&#8217;s words were coldly inquiring, but
inwardly it was very different. A mighty hope was
surging through him. The awful suspense had for
the moment dropped from his sickening heart, and
he felt like shouting aloud in his joy. The Indian
saw nothing of this, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they near. So. One sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth heard the news and remained silent. One day
off! He could hardly realize it. He turned away
and scanned the horizon. Jim Crow grew impatient.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; the fi&#8217; dollar?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was something so unsophisticated in the
man&#8217;s rascality that Seth almost smiled. He turned
on him severely, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been workin&#8217; with your countrymen,
murderin&#8217; an&#8217; lootin&#8217;, an&#8217; now you see the game&#8217;s up
you come around to me, ready to sell &#8217;em same as
you&#8217;d sell us. Say, you&#8217;re a durned skunk of an Indian!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Crow no Indian. I, Jim Crow, scout,&#8221; the
man retorted.</p>
<p>Seth eyed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. You figger to git scoutin&#8217; agin when this
is through. Say, you&#8217;re wuss&#8217;n I thought. You&#8217;re
wuss&#8217;n&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off, struck with a sudden thought. In a
moment he had dropped his tone of severity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span></p>
<p>&#8220;See, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to hand you twenty dollars,&#8221; he
said, holding the other&#8217;s shifty eyes with his own
steady gaze, &#8220;if you&#8217;ve a notion to earn &#8217;em an&#8217; act
squar&#8217;. Say, I ken trust you if I pay you. You
ain&#8217;t like the white Injun, Nevil Steyne, who&#8217;s bin
Black Fox&#8217;s wise man so long. After he&#8217;d fixed the
mischief he gits around to us an&#8217; turns on the Indians.
He&#8217;s fought with us. An&#8217; he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to fight
with us to-morrow. He&#8217;s a traitor to the Indians.
You belong to the whites, and you come to help us
when you can. Now, see here. You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to
make north hard as hell &#8217;ll let you, savee? An&#8217;
if the soldiers git here at sundown to-morrow night,
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to give you twenty dollars, and I&#8217;ll see
you&#8217;re made head scout agin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth waited for his answer. It came in a great
tone of self-confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I, Jim Crow, make soldiers dis night. So.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. You act squar&#8217;. You ain&#8217;t no traitor to
the white man, same as Nevil Steyne&#8217;s traitor to the
Indian, which I guess Black Fox likely knows by
this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Black Fox know.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>THE LAST STAND</h3>
</div>

<p>Sunrise brought the alarm. The call to arms
came in the midst of breakfast. But it came to men
who were discussing possibilities with smiling faces,
and to women who were no longer held silent by
the dread of the last few days. For all had shared
in Seth&#8217;s news. And if ever words were graven on
the hearts of human beings, Seth&#8217;s announcement,
&#8220;Troops are comin&#8217; from the north,&#8221; would most
certainly have been found inscribed on the hearts of
the defenders of White River Farm.</p>
<p>The attack began as the sun cleared the horizon,
and continued all day. Like the first few raindrops
of a storm-shower the enemy&#8217;s bullets hissed through
the air or spattered upon the buildings. Their long-range
firing did little harm, for Indians are notoriously
bad marksmen.</p>
<p>The sun mounted; the hours crept by. The attack
was general, and each minute diminished the
enveloping circle. The Indians had learned many
lessons during the past six days, and not the least of
them the utter folly of recklessness. Now they
crawled upon their bellies through the grass, offering
the smallest possible target to the keen-eyed garrison.
But even so their death-roll was enormous.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
The plainsmen held them at their mercy, and it was
only their vast numbers that gave them headway.
Death had no terrors for them. As each man
drooped his head upon the earth another was there
to take his place; and so the advance was maintained.</p>
<p>Noon drew near; the ever-narrowing circle was
close upon the farm.</p>
<p>There was no sound of voices, only the sharp
cracking of rifles, or the ping of bullets whistling
through the air as the Indians returned the biting
fire of their intended victims. It was a life and
death struggle against time, and both besieged and
besiegers knew it.</p>
<p>Seth watched with quiet eyes but with mind no
less anxious that he did not show it. He had no fixed
station like the others. He moved here, there, and
everywhere watching, watching, and encouraging
with a quiet word, or lending his aid with a shot
wherever pressure seemed to be greatest.</p>
<p>Noon passed. The whole plain was now alive
with the slowly creeping foe stealing upon the
doomed fort. The head of the advance was within
three hundred yards of the stockade.</p>
<p>Parker was at Seth&#8217;s side. Both were aiming at
a party of young braves, endeavoring to outstrip
their fellows by a series of short rushes. For some
moments they silently picked them off, like men
breaking pipes in a shooting gallery. The last had
just fallen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s red-hot this time,&#8221; observed the Agent, turning
his attention in a fresh direction. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be
lucky if we hold out until to-night.&#8221; He was
blackened with perspiration and dust. He wore
three bandoliers bristling with ammunition over a
torn and stained shirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess so,&#8221; Seth replied. &#8220;This &#8217;ll last another
two hours, I&#8217;m figgerin&#8217;, then we&#8217;ll&mdash;git busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fresh rush had started and the two rifles were
kept at work. The Indians fell like ninepins, but
there were always more to come on.</p>
<p>Hargreaves joined them a moment. He, too,
was terribly war-worn. He still wore his clerical
stock, but it had lost all semblance to its original
shape.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re rushing us everywhere, Seth,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Seth replied while he aimed at another daring
warrior.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he said, and fired.</p>
<p>Hargreaves went back to his post. There must
be no waste of time. This gentle pastor had little
of gentleness about him now. A good Christian in
every way, he still had no thought of turning the
other cheek when women were in peril.</p>
<p>By three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon the rush became
general. The defenders had no time even to keep
their rifles cool. A steady fire was kept up, and the
Indians were picked off like flies. But the gaps
were filled by men beyond all description in their
recklessness. Nothing could stem the tide. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
drew nearer and nearer like the waters of an oncoming
sea. The end was looming. It was very near.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in response to an order from Seth, some
of the women left the shelter of the house and
followed him. A few minutes later the well was
working, and a chain of buckets was passing up to
the roof of the house. A process of saturation was
put into operation. The thatch was soaked until the
water ran through the ceilings.</p>
<p>While this was going on a cry came from the
northern extremity. The first Indian had reached
the stockade and paid the penalty of his temerity.</p>
<p>Now orders, swift and sharp, passed from lip to
lip. Seth was everywhere. The battle would be in
full swing in a minute.</p>
<p>Suddenly Rube and Nevil appeared from a small
outhouse rolling two large barrels. These were
stood on end and the heads knocked out of them.
The pails used for water were requisitioned; a fresh
saturation went forward; this time it was the log
stockade, and the saturation was being performed
with coal-oil.</p>
<p>The sun was already dropping over the western
horizon when a party of the enemy, in face of the
fiercest fire, reached the defences. It was the
moment Seth had awaited. From the stockade
he called out a sharp order to the women in the
upper parts of the house, and the loyal creatures,
distracted with the nervous tension of inaction,
poured out a deadly volley.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></p>
<p>The terrible bombardment of short range weapons
had instant effect. The enemy fell back under the
withering hail. Headed by Seth a dozen men
mounted the ramparts, and the next instant the vast
corral formed a circle of leaping flame in the faces
of the besiegers. The coal-oil had done its work,
and the resinous pine logs yielded to the demands
of those who needed their service.</p>
<p>The defence was consummate. For the great
walls were sufficiently far from the buildings to
render life possible within the fiery circle.</p>
<p>Baffled and furious, the Indians fell back before a
foe they were powerless to combat. At a respectful
distance they watched the conflagration with wonder.
The magical abruptness of it filled them for a moment
with superstitious awe. But this phase did not
last long.</p>
<p>The gates were the weak spot, and they quickly
burnt through. In half an hour they crashed from
their hinges, and the lynx-eyed foe beheld the breach
thus open before them. They charged to the assault,
while inside the defenders stood ready for them
just beyond the range of the fierce heat.</p>
<p>Now was given an example of that strange,
fanatical courage for which the red man is so famous.
To pass the breach was like passing through a living
furnace, for the fire was raging at its full height
upon each side. There was no hesitation, no
shrinking.</p>
<p>Those nearest it charged the opening, and as they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
came were mowed down by the rifles waiting for
them. Again and again was the gateway besieged,
and the roasting human flesh sent up a nauseous
reek upon the smoke-laden air. Nothing could
exceed the insensate fearlessness of these benighted
creatures, nothing the awful slaughter which the
white defenders dealt out.</p>
<p>But the superior intelligence and skill of the white
men served them for only a time against the daring
horde. Dozens rushed to the sacrifice, but ever
there were more behind asking for the death of their
comrades. And inch by inch they drove through
the opening to within striking distance. They had
abandoned their firearms, and, with hatchet and
tomahawk, their natural close-quarter weapons, the
final struggle began.</p>
<p>All that had gone before was as nothing to the
fight that waxed now. The howling mob were within
the defences, and there was only one possible outcome.
The position was one of those when the true
spirit of the frontiersman is at its highest and grandest
pitch.</p>
<p>Gradually the riflemen on each flank dropped
back before the raging mob.</p>
<p>The rank, of which Rube was the centre, stood.
Here was no rifle practice. Revolvers were at work
with the rapidity of maxim guns. As they were
emptied, they were passed back and reloaded by
the women. But even this was inadequate to hold
the mob.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></p>
<p>Suddenly Rube, prompted by that feeling which
is in the heart of every man of mighty muscle,
abandoned his revolver, and, clubbing his rifle, reverted
to the methods of the old savage. He swung
it around his head like a flail, and crashed it amongst
those directly in front of him. And his action became
an example for the rest. Every rifle was
clubbed, and by sheer might, and desperate exertion,
the defenders cleared a space before them. The
great Rube advanced, his rugged face fiercely
alight. He could no longer wait for attack; he went
to meet it, his giant form towering amidst the crowd,
and the rest following.</p>
<p>The scene was one never to be forgotten. He
hewed a road for himself through the living crush,
his rifle butt crashing amongst heads recklessly, indiscriminately,
but urged with all the might of his
giant strength. Seth and the Agent, and Nevil and
the minister were his chief supporters. And there
was a light in the cleric&#8217;s eyes, such as had never
been seen there before by any of his flock, and a
devilish joy in his heart as he felt the concussion of
his blows upon heads that crushed beneath them.</p>
<p>Back they drove the howling throng, back toward
the fiery gateway. It literally crumpled before their
furious attack. But as the warriors fell back the
progress of the white men slowed and finally ceased
altogether, for the masses beyond were pressing, and
so packed were the savages that they could not retreat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span></p>
<p>Darkness was settling over the land. The Indians
rallied as the first fury of the white men&#8217;s onslaught
spent itself. The red men, stern fighters at all times,
were quick to seize upon the advantage. And their
counter was no less furious than the defenders&#8217; assault
had been. Step by step, with hatchets gleaming in
the yellow light, they regained their lost ground.</p>
<p>Slowly the white men were beaten back; all but
Rube, whose fury was unabated. He had cleared a
space for himself, from which the fiercest efforts of
the enemy could not dislodge him.</p>
<p>Shouting to those behind to care for the women,
Seth sprang to the old man&#8217;s side, and, setting his
back to his, stood to help him. Retreat was cut off,
but, all unconcerned for everything, like a maddened
bull, Rube sought only to slay, to crush, to add to
the tally of the dying and dead.</p>
<p>How the last moments of that terrible final stand
were passed, Seth could never have told. His long
illness was telling on him. His weakness affected
him sorely. All he was aware of were his companion&#8217;s
mighty blows, and the fury that was driving
him. That, and the necessity to defend him on his
unprotected side. He fought as he could. No skill
guided him. Now, at last, he had no cunning, and
he was hazily conscious of his ineffectiveness.</p>
<p>Once he was forced to his knees by the blow of a
hatchet, which, glancing down his clubbed rifle, took
him in the neck with its flat. It was at that moment
that his senses became aware of a distant bugle call.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
He scarcely recognized it, and, certainly, at the moment,
it brought him no understanding.</p>
<p>Instinctively he struggled to his feet and fought
on. Curiously enough, a moment later, his dulled
senses made him aware of a shudder passing over
his companion&#8217;s frame. He knew that Rube staggered,
just as he was made aware that he recovered,
and, with a sudden access of fury, renewed the fight.
He knew that his friend had been badly hit, and was
putting forth his last reserve of strength.</p>
<p>In the midst of this last struggle he heard the bugle
again, but this time it was louder. Its note rose high
above the noise of battle, the roar of the flames. But
even so, he did not take its meaning until he heard
a mighty cheer go up from his comrades within the
defences.</p>
<p>He roused; a great joy thrilled him. His head suddenly
became clear, and his weakness passed from him
like the lifting of some depressing cloud. He found
himself able to put forth a last exertion, and at this
juncture he was somehow standing at Rube&#8217;s side,
instead of at his back.</p>
<p>Of one accord, and without a word, they charged
the howling mob. They smote with their heavy
rifles in every direction, shouting as they went, driving
all before them. A mighty triumph was in Seth&#8217;s
heart; he had no room for anything else, no thought
for anything else. Even he was blinded to the old
man&#8217;s condition. It was not until he was joined by
the rest of the defenders, and the Indians were wildly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
struggling over one another to escape through the
still blazing gateway, and the old man fell like a log
at his side in the midst of the pursuit, that he realized
what had happened. Rube was bleeding from a
gaping wound at the base of his neck.</p>
<p>Just for one instant he saw the gateway fill with
uniformed horsemen, then Seth fell on his knees at
his foster-father&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>There was no attempt to pursue the Indians.
Weary and exhausted the little garrison gathered
mutely round the fallen man. Ma was at Seth&#8217;s side.
She had raised her husband&#8217;s head, and her old gray
eyes were peering tenderly anxious into his. While
she was still supporting him, some one pushed a way
to her side. One bare white arm was thrust through
hers, and a hand was gently laid on the old man&#8217;s
rugged forehead. Ma turned inquiringly upon the
intruder, and found herself staring into a pair of tearful,
violet eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rosebud!&#8221; she cried. And instantly the tears
slowly rolled down her worn cheeks, the first tears,
she had shed during that last terrible week.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>THE SENTENCE</h3>
</div>

<p>The relief of the farm was really only the beginning
of the campaign. It meant that following on its
heels the great northern posts were pouring out their
thousands of troops, and that a general advance was
in progress. It meant that now, at last, but, alas!
too late to avert the awful massacre of the white settlers,
the force was adequate to the task of subjugating
the savages.</p>
<p>The flying column that had ridden to the rescue
was a small band of picked men, with a couple of
light machine guns. It was composed of veteran
Indian fighters, who, fully understanding the desperate
chances of thus cutting themselves off from
their supports, and riding into the very jaws of
death, were yet ready to do it again and again.</p>
<p>The Indians, believing this initial attack of white
troops to be the immediate advance guard of an
overwhelming force, withdrew in something very
like panic. But with morning light they realized
they had been &#8220;bluffed&#8221; and at once returned to
the attack.</p>
<p>For the defenders, however, all real anxiety was
past. They knew that a sweeping movement was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
progress throughout the whole disturbed area, and
it was only a question of days before the Indians
would be shepherded back to their Reservations.</p>
<p>The mischief, however, was done, the country
was devastated. The prosperous farming region
was laid waste, and the labor of years utterly destroyed.
Of the survivors of the awful holocaust
the majority found themselves utterly ruined; their
homes destroyed; their possessions gone. Many
were wounded, and all were homeless. Their plight
was pitiable.</p>
<p>While others showered their praise and thanks and
rough compliments upon the girl who had dared all
to bring her friends the help they so sorely needed;
while old men and young rivaled each other in
their admiration of her reckless courage; while the
women sought to minister to her, and wept over her,
Seth held aloof, working and organizing for the
general comfort and well-being with that everlasting
thought for others which was so great a part of
his nature.</p>
<p>It was not that he was indifferent; it was not that
he had no thanks to tender. His heart was full,
full to the brim with pride for this girl he loved.
Hers, he felt, had been the great foresight, hers
the great courage to carry out their only possible
salvation. When his grave eyes had first fallen
upon the slight blanketed figure of the little white
squaw he recognized indeed the clever head which
had done more than trust to rash courage. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
would have been impossible for him to love her
more.</p>
<p>Nevertheless his was the first greeting when she
had been discovered in their midst. His had been
the first hand to grip hers. But there was no
effusion. Nothing but what, to strange ears, might
have sounded cold and wanting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, little Rosie,&#8221; was all he had said, while
his hand held hers. But, at that moment, the girl
would rather have foregone life itself than the
glance he bestowed upon her out of his grave, dark
eyes.</p>
<p>It was many days before any freedom from the
fortress farm could be enjoyed. But at last the time
came round when the troops began to converge
upon the Reservations, and the shepherding process
swept the Indians to their homes, a dejected horde,
hating but cowed for the moment. As before, as
always, their fierce fires of savagery were alight;
they were only burning low, for, as every plainsman
knows, they are unquenchable.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon when the news of their
freedom flew through the camp. None but those
who have passed through a similar ordeal can
realize the unutterable joy and thankfulness that filled
each heart. Though possessions had gone and
many were absolutely ruined, still liberty was theirs
at last. Liberty with its boundless possibilities.</p>
<p>Seth was sitting alone, propped against the
charred gate-post of the stockade. He was smoking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
and resting, and incidentally thinking deeply
after a long day&#8217;s work. There was much to think
about. Rube was slowly recovering under the careful
hands of his devoted wife. Mrs. Rickards and
Rosebud had relieved the farmwife of all her duties
that she might be free to lavish her utmost care
upon her staunch old friend and husband. The
future prospects of the farm were less involved than
the affairs of most of the farmers. The setback of
the rebellion was tremendous, but years of thrift had
left White River Farm independent of a single year&#8217;s
crops. Besides the farmhouse and buildings were
intact.</p>
<p>But none of these things was in his mind just
now. There was something else which filled his
heart with unutterable bitterness, which revealed
itself in the hard, thoughtful stare of his dark eyes as
he gazed out upon the wide encampment of soldiers
spreading itself out in all directions.</p>
<p>Every now and then he shifted his gaze into a
certain direction, only to turn away with apparent
indifference and let his eyes wander over every
chance object that attracted them. Once the Agent
came to him and they spoke for some moments in a
low tone. Then he was again left to his thoughts.
The sun dipped below the horizon, and the twilight
waned. He remained at his post. There could be
no doubt now that he was waiting with some fixed
purpose.</p>
<p>At last he turned decidedly in the direction in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
which he had been so frequently glancing, and this
time his movement was anticipatory. A dark figure
was approaching from among the tents. It was
the scout, Jim Crow, who came up and squatted
at the white man&#8217;s side. The two talked together
for a long time, and at last the Indian rose to depart.</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; he said, in his pompous fashion, &#8220;I do these
things. I, Jim Crow. Good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done good work,&#8221; Seth responded
casually. &#8220;And you&#8217;ve been paid for it, I guess.
See you do this, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>He watched the Indian while he solemnly spat
upon the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;I, Jim Crow, have said.&#8221; And with this vaunting
claim to honesty the scout abruptly turned and
moved away.</p>
<p>A moment later Seth made his way slowly to a
small outhouse. He raised the latch of the door and
passed within. There were two occupants. The
Indian Agent was sitting at a little table smoking
and reading, and Nevil Steyne was lying full length
upon some outspread blankets upon the floor.
This place was the temporary abode of the three
men. The farmhouse had been given up to the
women and children.</p>
<p>Seth took a seat. As he came in Parker closed
his book and put it away. From his blankets Nevil
glanced up quickly, and continued to watch the
movements of both with expectant eyes. He was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
aware that permission had been given for every one
to leave the farm. Nor did he delude himself. He
knew that he was a prisoner.</p>
<p>Seth placed his chair so that he was in full view
of the man on the blankets. And his first words
were addressed to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to quit this farm,&#8221; he said,
calmly, but in a manner which compelled his prisoner&#8217;s
attention. &#8220;I&#8217;ve thought a heap, an&#8217; that&#8217;s how
I&#8217;ve got figgerin&#8217;. You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to quit this night.
That is ef you&#8217;re so minded.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, but his grave eyes still surveyed the
ungainly form, still stared coldly into the lean unshaven
face, into the shifty pale eyes. Nevil made
no response. He knew instinctively that this was
only a prelude to more that was to follow.</p>
<p>Parker watched Seth. In a measure he was
mystified, for the plainsman had never given him his
full confidence with regard to Nevil. He suspected
a lot, but that was all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I don&#8217;t need to tell you a deal about yourself,&#8221;
Seth went on presently. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just mention
that Nevil Steyne ain&#8217;t your real name, an&#8217; it
wouldn&#8217;t take me guessin&#8217; long to locate the other.
That&#8217;s as mebbe. You&#8217;re a skunk,&#8221; he proceeded,
without raising his voice. &#8220;You&#8217;re wuss&#8217;n a yaller
dawg, but even a yaller dawg mostly has an option.
That&#8217;s how it is wi&#8217; you, seein&#8217; you&#8217;re o&#8217; that breed.
I ain&#8217;t no feelin&#8217; o&#8217; mercy for you anyways, but I&#8217;ll
give you a chance. Ef you stay right here ther&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
the courts as &#8217;ll hang you sure; ef you quit, ther&#8217;s
the Injuns as you&#8217;ve lived by, an&#8217; as you fooled
to suit your own dirty schemes. I don&#8217;t see
as ther&#8217;s a great choice for you. Your game&#8217;s
played, an&#8217; you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to cash in, an&#8217; it kind o&#8217;
seems to me you&#8217;ve got to pay anyways. Wal,
you&#8217;ll choose right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil had sat up while the other was speaking.
He gave no outward sign beyond that one movement.
Now he slowly rose to his feet and looked
down upon the set face of the arbiter of his fate a
little uncertainly. He turned from him to the Agent,
who was looking on in no little puzzlement. Then
his eyes came back to the relentless face of Seth, and
he seemed to be struggling to penetrate the sphinx-like
expression he beheld.</p>
<p>He scented danger, he knew there was danger.
But even so his mind was made up. He would not
face the jury of his white brothers. He believed he
understood the Indians, and saw chances in this
direction. But there was the wonder why Seth had
given him the chance. He had no time to debate
the question. His answer was needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go back to the Indians,&#8221; he said, with a hateful
laugh, in which there was no semblance of mirth.
&#8220;As you suggest, a yellow dog can always run for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest so. It ken allus run.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the full bitterness of his position swept over
the renegade, and a deep rage stirred the hatred he
held for this man who had outwitted him at every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
turn, and now was in a position to pronounce sentence
upon him. And his words came low with
concentrated fury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, blast you, you can sneer! But I tell you
you&#8217;re making a mistake. I can twist the Indians
around my finger. Bah, I care nothing for them! I
shall get clear and save myself, and, as sure as
there&#8217;s a hell for the damned, you shall pay!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the man he addressed remained undisturbed.
His manner was imperturbable. He nodded gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now git&mdash;git quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the man who posed as Nevil Steyne passed
out of the hut and out of the fort, urged almost to
precipitancy by the suggestion of Seth&#8217;s final command.</p>
<p>After his going silence reigned in the little corn
shed. Parker had a hundred questions to ask, but
none of them came readily to his lips in face of his
companion&#8217;s silence. In the end it was Seth who
spoke first.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; he said, with a sigh, &#8220;that&#8217;s settled.&#8221; His
words were an expression of relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand. You&#8217;ve let him go. You&#8217;ve
given him a chance to get away in safety after&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; responded the other grimly, &#8220;a dawg&#8217;s
chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer silenced all further protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Seth went on reflectively, &#8220;I&#8217;ve done with
him, I guess; we all have. Say, he&#8217;s Rosebud&#8217;s
uncle.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Parker was beginning to understand.
But he was not yet satisfied, and his ejaculation was
an invitation to the other.</p>
<p>Seth went on as though in soliloquy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He&#8217;s gone, an&#8217; ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no tellin&#8217; where
he&#8217;ll finish. Ther&#8217;s a hell some&#8217;eres. Mebbe he
ken twist &#8217;em, the Injuns, around his finger, mebbe
he can&#8217;t. I &#8217;lows he goin&#8217; to face &#8217;em. They&#8217;ll deal
out by him as they notion justice, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he may escape them. He&#8217;s slippery.&#8221;
Parker hated the thought of the man going scot-free.</p>
<p>Seth shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He&#8217;ll face &#8217;em. I&#8217;ve seen to
that, I guess. Jim Crow follers him wherever he
goes. An&#8217; Jim Crow hain&#8217;t no use for Stephen
Raynor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think will happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>Parker looked up into the taller man&#8217;s face as they
stood in the doorway of the hut.</p>
<p>Seth turned. His shoulders shrugged expressively
as he moved out and walked toward the farmhouse.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>WANAHA THE INDIAN</h3>
</div>

<p>The moon at its full shone down upon a scene of
profound silence. Its silvery rays overpowered the
milder starry sheen of the heavens. The woods upon
the banks of the White River were tipped with a
hard, cold burnish, but their black depths remained
unyielding. All was still&mdash;so still.</p>
<p>Thousands of Indians are awaiting in silent, stubborn
hatred the morrow&#8217;s sentence of their white
shepherds. A deep passion of hatred and revenge
lies heavy on their tempestuous hearts; and upon
the heart of their warlike chieftain most of all.</p>
<p>The heart that beats within the Indian bosom is
invincible. It is beyond the reach of sympathy, as
it is beyond the reach of fear. It stands alone in its
devotion to warlike brutality. Hatred is its supreme
passion, just as fearlessness is its supreme virtue.
And hatred and revenge are moving to-night&mdash;moving
under the calm covering of apparent peace;
moving now lest the morrow should put it beyond
the power of the red man to mete out the full measure
of his lust for native savagery. And so at last
there comes a breaking of the perfect peace of night.</p>
<p>A dark figure moves out of the depths of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
woods. It moves slowly toward the log hut of Nevil
Steyne. It pauses at a distance and surveys the dim
outline against the woodland backing.</p>
<p>Another figure moves out from the woods, and a
moment later another and yet another; and each
figure follows in the track of the foremost, and they
stand talking in low murmurs. Thus twenty-five
blanketed figures are gathered before the hut of the
white renegade. They are Indians, hoary-headed
patriarchs of their race, but glowing with the fierce
spirit of youth in their sluggish hearts.</p>
<p>Presently they file away one by one, and it becomes
apparent that each old man is well armed.
They spread out and form themselves into a wide
circle, which slowly closes in upon the hut. Then
each decrepit figure huddles itself down upon its
haunches, like some bald-headed vulture settling
with heavily flapping wings upon its prey.</p>
<p>Sleep has not visited the eyes of those within the
hut. When things go awry with those who live by
double-dealing, sleep does not come easily. Nevil
Steyne is awake, and his faithful wife keeps him
company.</p>
<p>The interior of the hut is dismantled. Bundles of
furnishings lie scattered about on the floor. It is
plain that this is to be the last night which these two
intend to spend in the log hut which has sheltered
them so long.</p>
<p>The squaw is lying fully dressed upon the bed, and
the man is sitting beside her smoking. They are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
talking, discussing eagerly that which has held the
man&#8217;s feverish interest the whole night.</p>
<p>There is no kindness in the man&#8217;s tone as he
speaks to the woman. He is beset with a fear he
cannot conceal. It is in his tone, it is in his eyes, it
is in his very restlessness.</p>
<p>The woman is calm. She is an Indian, and in her
veins runs the blood of generations of great chiefs.
Fear has no place in her heart, but her devotion to
her man makes her anxious for him. Her slow, labored
use of his language is meant to encourage
him, but he takes no comfort from it. His utter
selfishness, his cowardice, place him beyond mere
verbal encouragement.</p>
<p>&#8220;It still wants two hours to dawn,&#8221; Nevil exclaimed,
referring to his watch for about the twentieth
time in the last hour. &#8220;God, how the time
hangs!&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s dark eyes were upon his nervous
face. She noted the anxious straining of his shifty
eyes. Their whites were bloodshot, and his brows
were drawn together in the painful concentration of
a mind fixed upon one thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will pass,&#8221; she said, with all the hopefulness
she could express.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it will. Do you suppose I don&#8217;t
know?&#8221; The man spoke with harsh irritation.
&#8220;You&mdash;you don&#8217;t seem to understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wanaha understands.&#8221; The squaw nodded.
Then she, too, gave way to a slight irritation. &#8220;Why
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
you not sleep, my Nevil? Wanaha watch. It a
long journey. Sleep, my husband. You fear foolish.
So.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man turned scornful eyes in her direction, and
for a moment did not speak. Then presently he
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I think it&#8217;s unnecessary for us to go.
I can&#8217;t make up my mind. I never had such difficulty
in seeing clearly before. Your brother was so
quiet and calm. He spoke so generously. I told
him the whole story. How I was forced by that
damned Seth to go into the fort. And how I was
forced to fight. Pshaw! what&#8217;s the use of talking?
I&#8217;ve told you all this already. Yet he listened to all
I had to say, and as I made each point he nodded
in that quiet, assured way of his&mdash;you know. I
think he understood and was satisfied. I think so&mdash;and
yet&mdash;it&#8217;s no use, I can&#8217;t be sure. I wish he&#8217;d
lost his temper in his usual headstrong way. I understand
him when he is like that. But he didn&#8217;t.
He was very calm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, my Wana, it seemed to me that
he&#8217;d heard my story before, told by some one else,
probably told with variations to suit themselves. It
seemed to me that&mdash;well, he was only listening to
me because he had to. I swear I&#8217;d give ten years
of my life to know what he really thinks. Yes, I
think I&#8217;m right. Once away from here we are safe.
Neither he nor any of the braves can follow us. The
soldiers will see that none leave the Reservations.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
Yes, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s best to get away. It can do no
harm, and it&#8217;s best to be sure. Still an hour and three-quarters,&#8221;
he finished up, again referring to his watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it best so,&#8221; the woman said in reply. She
understood the condition of her husband&#8217;s mind.
She saw clearly that she must humor him.</p>
<p>Whatever her innermost thoughts may have been
she made her replies subservient to his humor. She
had listened closely to his account of his interview
with her brother, and there is little doubt that
she had formed her own opinion, and, being of the
blood of the chief, she probably understood him better
than this white man did. But whatever she really
thought no word of it escaped her.</p>
<p>Another silence fell. Again it was the man who
broke it.</p>
<p>&#8220;That Jim Crow is very active. He comes and
goes all day. He interviews Little Black Fox whenever
he pleases. He&#8217;s a two-faced rascal. Do you
know, it was he who brought the news of relief to the
farm. And what&#8217;s more, he came in with the soldiers.
I always seem to see him about. Once I
thought he was watching my movements. I wonder
why?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man drooped dejectedly as he tried to unravel
this fresh tangle. Why was Jim Crow shadowing
him? In the interests of the Indians? Again he
pulled out his watch. And the woman beside him
saw that his hand was shaking as he held it out to
the light of the stove.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></p>
<p>It was time to hitch up his horses, he said. Yet
they were not starting until dawn, and it still wanted
a full hour to the time.</p>
<p>Wanaha sat up, and Nevil moved about amongst
the litter of their belongings. There was coffee on
the stove and food on the table. He helped himself
to both, bolting meat and drink in a nervous, hasty
manner. Wanaha joined him. She ate sparingly,
and then began to gather their goods together.</p>
<p>Nevil turned to her. He was preparing to fetch
the horses which were picketed out on the prairie.
He was in better mood now. Action restored in him
a certain amount of confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be good to get away, my Wana,&#8221; he
said, for a moment laying one hand upon her
shoulder.</p>
<p>The woman looked up into his mean face with a
world of love in her profound eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It good to be with you&mdash;anywhere, my Nevil,&#8221;
she said, in her quiet way.</p>
<p>The man turned to the door.</p>
<p>He raised the latch and threw it open. He stood
speechless. A panic was upon him; he could not
move, he could not think. Little Black Fox was
standing in the doorway, and, behind him, two of
his war-councilors leaning on their long, old-fashioned
rifles.</p>
<p>Without a word, the chief, followed by his two attendants,
stepped within. The door was closed
again. Then Little Black Fox signed to Wanaha
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
for a light. The squaw took the oil-lamp from a
shelf and lit it, and the dull, yellow rays revealed the
disorder of the place.</p>
<p>The chief gazed about him. His handsome face
was unmoved. Finally he looked into the face of the
terror-stricken renegade. Nevil was tall, but he was
dwarfed by the magnificent carriage and superb figure
of the savage.</p>
<p>It was the chief who was the first to speak. The
flowing tongue of the Sioux sounded melodious in
the rich tones of the speaker&#8217;s voice. He spoke
without a touch of the fiery eloquence which had
been his when he was yet the untried leader of his
race. The man seemed to have suddenly matured.
He was no longer the headstrong boy that had conceived
an overwhelming passion for a white girl, but
a warrior of his race, a warrior and a leader.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother would go from his friends? So?&#8221;
he said in feigned surprise. &#8220;And my sister, Wanaha?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wanaha obeys her lord. Whither he goes she
goes. It is good.&#8221;</p>
<p>The squaw was alive to the position, but, unlike
her white husband, she rose to the occasion. The
haughty manner of the chief was no more haughty
than hers. She was blood of this man, and no less
royal than he. Her deep eyes were alert and shining
now. The savage was dominant in her again.
She was, indeed, a princess of her race.</p>
<p>&#8220;And whither would they go, this white brother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
and his squaw?&#8221; There was a slight irony in the
Indian&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>Again the squaw answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;We go where white men and Indians live in
peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No white man or Indian lives in peace where he
goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Little Black Fox pointed scornfully at the cowering
white man. The squaw had no answer ready.
But the renegade himself found his tongue and answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;We go until the white man&#8217;s anger is passed,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Then we return to the great chief&#8217;s
camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a while the young chieftain&#8217;s eyes seemed to
burn into those of the man before him, so intense
was the angry fire of his gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;because you fear to
stay. It is not the white man you fear, but the
Indian you have betrayed. Your tongue lies, your
heart lies. You are neither brave nor squaw-man.
Your heart is the heart of a snake that is filled with
venom. Your brain is like the mire of the muskeg
which sucks, sucks its victims down to destruction.
Your blood is like the water of a mosquito swamp,
poisonous even to the air. I have eyes; I have
ears. I learn all these things, and I say nothing.
The hunter uses a poisoned weapon. It matters not
so that he brings down his quarry. But his weapon
is for his quarry, and not for himself. He destroys
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
it when there is danger that he shall get hurt by it.
You are a poisoned weapon, and you have sought
to hurt me. So.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wanaha suddenly stepped forward. Her great
eyes blazed up into her brother&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;The great chief wrongs my man. All he has
done he was forced to do. His has been the heart
to help you. His has been the hand to help you.
His has been the brain to plan for you. So. The
others come. They take him prisoner. He must
fight for them or die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then if he fights he is traitor. So he must
die.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil had no word for himself. He was beyond
words. Even in his extremity he remembered what
Seth had said to him. And he knew now that Seth&#8217;s
knowledge of the Indians was greater, far deeper,
than his. This was his &#8220;dog&#8217;s chance,&#8221; but he had
not even the privilege of a run.</p>
<p>The irony of his lot did not strike him. Crimes
which he had been guilty of had nothing to do with
his present position. Instead, he stood arraigned
for a treachery which had not been his, toward the
one man to whom he had ever been faithful.</p>
<p>But while his craven heart wilted before his savage
judge; while his mind was racked with tortures of
suspense, and his scheming brain had lost its power
of concentration; while his limbs shook at the presentiment
of his doom, his woman stood fearless at
his side, ready to serve him to the bitter end, ready
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
to sacrifice herself if need be that his wretched life
might be saved.</p>
<p>Now she replied to her brother&#8217;s charge, with her
beautiful head erect and her bosom heaving.</p>
<p>&#8220;No man is coward who serves you as he has
served you,&#8221; she cried, her eyes confronting her
brother&#8217;s with all the fearless pride of her race.
&#8220;The coward is the other. The one who turns
upon his friend and helper when misfortune
drives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words stung as they were meant to sting.
And something of the old headstrong passion leapt
into the young chief&#8217;s heart. He pointed at his
sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough!&#8221; he cried; and a movement of the
head conveyed a command to his attendants. They
stepped forward. But Wanaha was quicker. She
met them, and, with upraised hand, waved them
back in a manner so imperious that they paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Black Fox forgets!&#8221; she cried, addressing
herself to her brother, and ignoring the war-councilors.
&#8220;No brave may lay hand upon the
daughter of my father. Little Black Fox is chief.
My blood is his blood. By the laws of our race his
is the hand that must strike. The daughter of Big
Wolf awaits. Let my brother strike.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she finished speaking Wanaha bowed her head
in token of submission. But for all his rage the
chief was no slayer of his womenfolk. The ready-witted
woman understood the lofty Indian spirit of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
her brother. She saw her advantage and meant to
hold it. She did not know what she hoped. She
did not pause to think. She had a woman&#8217;s desire
to gain time only. And as she saw her brother
draw back she felt that, for the moment at least, she
was mistress of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; she went on, raising her head again and
proudly confronting the angry-eyed youth, &#8220;my
brother, even in his wrath, remembers the law of our
race. Let him think further, and he will also remember
other things. Let him say to himself, &#8216;I
may not slay this man while my sister, Wanaha,
lives. She alone has power to strike. The council
of chiefs may condemn, but she must be the executioner.&#8217;
So! And my brother will be in the right,
for Wanaha is the blood of Big Wolf, and the white
man is her husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>The headstrong chief was baffled. He knew that
the woman was right. The laws of the Sioux race
were as she had said. And they were so stringent
that it would be dangerous to set them aside, even
though this man&#8217;s death had been decided upon by
the unanimous vote of the council. He stood irresolute,
and Wanaha added triumph to her tone as
she went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, great chief, this man&#8217;s life is mine. And I,
Wanaha, your sister, refuse to take it. For me he
is free.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Wanaha in her womanish enthusiasm had
overshot her mark. The laws were strong, but this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
wild savage&#8217;s nature was as untamed and fearless as
any beast of the field. It was her tone of triumph
that undid her.</p>
<p>Little Black Fox suddenly whipped out a long
hunting-knife from his belt and flung it upon the
table with a great clatter. It lay there, its vicious,
gleaming blade shining dully in the yellow lamplight.</p>
<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; he cried, his voice thick with fury.
&#8220;Have your rights! I go. With the first streak
of dawn I come again. Then I slay! Wanaha
shall die by my hand, and then she has no right to
the life of the white man!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The first streak of dawn lit the eastern sky. The
horses were grazing, tethered to their picket ropes
within view of the log hut down by the river. The
wagon stood in its place at the side of the building.
There was no firelight to be seen within the building,
no lamplight.</p>
<p>The circle of silent squatting figures still held their
vigil.</p>
<p>As the daylight grew three figures emerged from
the woods and moved silently to the door of the
hut. They paused, listening, but no sound came
from within. One, much taller than his companions,
reached out and raised the latch. The door swung
open. He paused again. Then he stepped across
the threshold.</p>
<p>The new-born day cast a gray twilight over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
interior. The man sniffed, like a beast of prey scenting
the trail of blood. And that which came to his
nostrils seemed to satisfy him, for he passed within
and strode to the bedside. He stood for a few moments
gazing down at the figures of a man and a
woman locked in each other&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p>He looked long and earnestly upon the calm features
of the faces so closely pressed together. There
was no pity, no remorse in his heart, for life and
death were matters which touched him not at all.
War was as the breath of his nostrils.</p>
<p>Presently he moved away. There was nothing to
keep him there. These two had passed together to
the shores of the Happy Hunting Ground. They
had lived and died together. They would&mdash;perhaps&mdash;awake
together. But not on the prairies of
the West.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h3>THE CAPITULATION</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know how it&#8217;s all going to end.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rickards drew a deep sigh of perplexity and
looked helplessly over at Ma, who was placidly
knitting at her husband&#8217;s bedside. The farmwife&#8217;s
bright face had lost nothing of its comeliness in spite
of the anxieties through which she had so recently
passed. Her twinkling eyes shone cheerily through
her glasses, and the ruddy freshness of her complexion
was still fair to see. A line or two, perhaps,
had deepened about her mouth, and the grayness
of her hair may have become a shade whiter. But
these things were hardly noticeable.</p>
<p>The change in Rosebud&#8217;s aunt was far more pronounced.
She had taken to herself something of
the atmosphere of the plains-folk in the few weeks
of her stay at the farm. And the subtle change had
improved her.</p>
<p>Rube was mending fast, and the two older women
now spent all their spare time in his company.</p>
<p>Ma looked up from her work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rube an&#8217; me have been discussin&#8217; it,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Guess we&#8217;ve settled to leave the farm, an&#8217; buy a
new place around some big city. I don&#8217;t rightly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
know how the boy &#8217;ll take it. Y&#8217; see, Seth&#8217;s mighty
hard to change, an&#8217; he&#8217;s kind o&#8217; fixed on this place.
Y&#8217; see, he&#8217;s young, an&#8217; Rube an&#8217; me&#8217;s had a longish
spell. We&#8217;d be pleased to take it easy now. Eh,
old man?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma glanced affectionately at the mighty figure
filling up the bed. The man nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Y&#8217; see, things don&#8217;t seem hard till you see your
old man&#8217;s blood runnin&#8217;,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Then&mdash;well,
I guess I ain&#8217;t no more stummick fer fight.
I&#8217;d be thankful to God A&#8217;mighty to end my days
peaceful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rickards nodded sympathetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quite wise,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It seems to me
you&#8217;ve earned a rest. The courage and devotion
of all you dear people out here have been a wonderful
education to me. Do you know, Mrs. Sampson,
I never knew what life really meant until I came
amongst you all. The hope, and love, and sympathy
on this prairie are something to marvel at. I
can understand a young girl&#8217;s desire to return to it
after once having tasted it. Even for me it has its
fascinations. The claims of civilization fall from one
out here in a manner that makes me wonder. I
don&#8217;t know yet but that I shall remain for a while
and see more of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma smiled and shook her head at the other&#8217;s enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a heap worth living for out here, I guess.
But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I know what you would say. A time
comes when you want rest for mind and body. I
wonder,&#8221; Mrs. Rickards went on thoughtfully, &#8220;if
Seth ever wants rest and peace? I don&#8217;t think it.
What a man!&#8221;</p>
<p>She relapsed into silent admiration of the man of
whom she was speaking. Ma noted her look. She
understood the different place Seth now occupied in
this woman&#8217;s thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I was not thinking about the affairs of this
farm and the Indians so much as something else,&#8221;
Mrs. Rickards went on presently, smiling from Ma
to Rube and back again at Ma.</p>
<p>The farmwife laid her knitting aside. She understood
the other&#8217;s meaning, and this was the first mention
of it between them. Even Rube had turned his
head and his deep-set eyes were upon the &#8220;fine
lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I was thinking of Seth and Rosebud,&#8221; she
went on earnestly. &#8220;You know that Rosebud&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ma nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth&#8217;s ter&#8217;ble slow,&#8221; she said slyly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think he&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221; The two women looked straight into
each other&#8217;s eyes, which smiled as only old women&#8217;s
eyes can smile when they are speaking of that which
is the greatest matter of their lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know how she regards him,&#8221; Mrs. Rickards
went on. &#8220;And I tell you frankly, Mrs. Sampson,
I was cordially opposed to it&mdash;when I came here.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
Even now I am not altogether sure it&#8217;s right by the
girl&#8217;s dead father&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; Ma&#8217;s face was serious while she
waited for the other to go on.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but&mdash;well, if I was a girl, and could get
such a man as Seth for a husband, I should be the
proudest woman in the land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;d be honored,&#8221; put in Rube, speaking
for the first time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rickards laughingly nodded.</p>
<p>Ma sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess Seth has queer notions. Mighty queer.
I &#8217;low, knowin&#8217; him as I do, I could say right here
that that boy &#8217;ud ask her right off, only fer her friends
an&#8217; her dollars. He&#8217;s a foolhead, some.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rickards laughed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;In England these things are usually an inducement,&#8221;
she said significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth&#8217;s a man,&#8221; said Ma with some pride. &#8220;Seth&#8217;s
real honest, an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;, far be it for me to say it, he&#8217;s
consequent a foolhead. What&#8217;s dollars when folks
love? Pshaw! me an&#8217; Rube didn&#8217;t think o&#8217; no
dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess we hadn&#8217;t no dollars to think of, Ma,&#8221;
murmured Rube in a ponderous aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal? An&#8217; if we had?&#8221; Ma smiled defiantly at
her &#8220;old man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, mebbe we&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; tho&#8217;t of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>The farmwife turned away in pretended disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t think anything will come of it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
suggested Mrs. Rickards, taking the opportunity of
returning to the matter under discussion.</p>
<p>Ma&#8217;s eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no sayin&#8217;,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Mebbe it&#8217;s best
left to Rosie.&#8221; She glanced again at her sick husband.
&#8220;Y&#8217; see, men mostly has notions, an&#8217; some
are ter&#8217;ble slow. But they&#8217;re all li&#8217;ble to act jest so,
ef the woman&#8217;s the right sort. Guess it ain&#8217;t no use
in old folks figgerin&#8217; out fer young folks. The only
figgerin&#8217; that counts is what they do fer themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8217;re right,&#8221; responded Mrs. Rickards,
wondering where the farmwife had acquired her fund
of worldly wisdom. Ma&#8217;s gentle shrewdness overshadowed
any knowledge she had acquired living
the ordinary social life that had been hers in England.</p>
<p>Ma&#8217;s worldly wisdom, however, was all on the surface.
She knew Seth, and she knew Rosebud. She
had watched their lives with loving eyes, prompted
by a great depth of sympathy. And all she had seen
had taught her that both were capable of managing
their own affairs, and, for the rest, her optimism induced
the belief that all would come right in the end.
And it was out of this belief she reassured her new-made
friend.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the little blind god was carrying on his
campaign with all the cunning and crushing strategy
for which he is justly renowned. There is no power
such as his in all the world. What he sets out to do
he accomplishes with a blissful disregard for circumstances.
Where obstacles refuse to melt at his advance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
he adopts the less comfortable, but none the
less effective, manner of breaking through them.
And perhaps he saw the necessity of some such
course in the case of Seth and Rosebud. Anyway,
he was not beaten yet.</p>
<p>The last of the refugees had left the farm. Seth
had been assisting in the departure of the various
families. It was a sad day&#8217;s work, and no one realized
the pathos of it more than the silent plainsman.
He had given his little all to the general welfare, but
he had been incapable of saving the homes that had
been built up with so much self-denial, so much thrift.
All he could do was to wish the departing folk Godspeed
with an accompaniment of cheery words,
which, perhaps, may have helped to lighten the
burden of some of them. The burden he knew was
a heavy one in all cases, but heavier in some than
others, for Death had claimed his toll, and at such a
time the tax fell doubly heavy.</p>
<p>It was over. He had just seen the last wagon
drop below the horizon. Now he turned away with
a sigh and surveyed the ruin around him. He
walked from place to place, inspecting each outbuilding
with a measuring eye. There were weeks of labor
before him, and all labor that would return no
profit. It was a fitting conclusion to a sad day&#8217;s
work.</p>
<p>But he was not given to morbid sentiment, and as
he inspected each result of the siege he settled in his
mind the order of the work as it must be done. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
setback like this had only a stimulating effect on his
spirit. The summer lay before him, and he knew
that by winter he could have everything restored to
order.</p>
<p>At the barn he made the horses snug for the night,
and then, taking up his favorite position on the oat-bin
at the open doorway, lit his pipe for a quiet
think. He was wholly responsible while Rube was
ill.</p>
<p>Sitting there in the golden light of the setting sun,
he was presently disturbed by the approach of light
footsteps. It was an unusually gay voice that greeted
him when he looked up, and eyes that were brighter,
and more deeply violet than ever.</p>
<p>Had he given thought to these things he might
have realized that there was something artificial in
Rosebud&#8217;s manner, something that told of unusual
excitement going on in her bosom. But then Seth,
with all his keenness in other things, was not the
cleverest of men where women were concerned.
Ma&#8217;s opinion of him was wonderfully accurate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Seth, I just came to tell you! Fancy, no
sooner is one excitement over than another begins.
I&#8217;ve just learned that Pa and Ma are going to give
up this farm. We are going further west, out of the
Indian territory, and Rube&#8217;s going to buy a new
farm near some city. Just fancy. What do you
think of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>For once Seth seemed taken aback. His usual imperturbable
manner forsook him, and he stared at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
girl in unfeigned astonishment. This was the last
thing he had expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re quittin&#8217; the farm?&#8221; he cried incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s precisely it,&#8221; Rosebud nodded, thoroughly
enjoying the other&#8217;s blank manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! I hadn&#8217;t tho&#8217;t of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl broke into a laugh, and Seth, after smiling
faintly in response, relapsed into serious thought.
Rosebud eyed him doubtfully for some moments.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not glad,&#8221; she said presently, with a wise
little nod. &#8220;You&#8217;re not glad. You don&#8217;t want to
go. You love this place and what you&#8217;ve helped to
make it. I know. So do I.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man nodded, and his dark face grew graver.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our home, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; the girl continued,
after a pause. &#8220;Just look round. There&#8217;s the new
barn. I remember when you and Pa built it. I used
to hold the wood while you sawed, and made you
angry because I always tried to make you cut it
crooked&mdash;and never succeeded. I was very small
then. There&#8217;s the old barn. We use it for cows
now. And do you remember when you pulled down
the old granary, and built the new one in the shape
of an elevator? And do you remember, Ma wouldn&#8217;t
speak to us for a whole day because we pulled the old
hen-roost to pieces and established the hogs there?
She said it was flying in the face of Providence having
the smelly old things so near the house. And
now we&#8217;re going to leave it all. We&#8217;re farmers,
aren&#8217;t we, Seth? But Pa is going in for cattle.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Cattle?&#8221; exclaimed Seth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But I&#8217;d rather that than another grain
farm after this one. I don&#8217;t think I could ever like
another grain farm so well as this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud had seated herself at Seth&#8217;s feet, with her
back to him so that he could not see her face. She
was dressed in a simple dark gown that made her
look very frail. Her golden hair was arranged in a
great loose knot at the nape of her neck from which
several unruly strands had escaped. Seth noted
these things even though his eyes wandered from
point to point as she indicated the various objects to
which she was drawing his attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is home, sure, Rosie,&#8221; he said at last, as
she waited for his answer. &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s home, sure.
Yours an&#8217; mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long pause. Rosebud leant against
Seth&#8217;s knees; and presently she raised one arm till
her elbow rested upon them. Then she supported
her head upon her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I think it&#8217;s right to go; Ma and Rube are
getting old. They want rest. Rube&#8217;s got a goodish
bit of capital, too,&#8221; she went on, with an almost
childish assumption of business knowledge. &#8220;And
so have you. Now how much will buy a nice
ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl had faced round and was gazing up into
Seth&#8217;s face with all the bland innocence of childhood
in her wide open eyes. The gravity she beheld there
was profound.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I&#8217;d say around twenty thousand dollars.
Y&#8217; see, stockin&#8217; it&#8217;s heavy. But Rube wouldn&#8217;t think
o&#8217; that much. Mebbe he&#8217;d buy a goodish place an&#8217;
raise the stock himself. I &#8217;lows it&#8217;s a money-makin&#8217;
game&mdash;is stock. It&#8217;s a good business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth had gained some enthusiasm while he spoke,
and the girl was quick to notice the change.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8217;re beginning to fancy the notion,&#8221;
she said, with a bright flash of her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth&#8217;s reply was half shamefaced. Rosebud removed
her arm from his knees and turned away, idly
drawing vague outlines upon the dusty ground with
her forefinger. She was smiling too. It was partly
a mischievous smile, and yet there was something
very nervous about it. She was thinking, thinking,
and found it very hard to say what she wanted to.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if you&#8217;d help me to do something I want
to do very much?&#8221; she asked at last. &#8220;Something
very, very particular?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sure,&#8221; was the ready answer. &#8220;That&#8217;s
how it&#8217;s allus bin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know. It&#8217;s always been like that. But
this is something much harder.&#8221; Rosebud smiled a
little wistfully into the strong face above her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ken gamble on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I can. I know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another silence fell. The girl continued to draw
outrageous parallelograms in the dust. Seth smoked
on, waiting for her. The last rays of the setting sun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
were shining athwart the golden head which his dark
eyes were contemplating.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I want to buy Pa and Ma the finest
ranch in Montana,&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;You see, I&#8217;ve
got lots of money,&#8221; she went on, laughing nervously.
&#8220;At least I shall have. I&#8217;m rather selfish, too, because
I&#8217;m going to live with them, always, you know.
And I&#8217;d like to live on a ranch. Pa could own it,
and you could be foreman and partner. And&mdash;and
I could be partner too. Quite a business arrangement.
Pa and you would work. That&#8217;s your share
of the capital. I should only find the money, and
do nothing. You see? I talked it over with&mdash;er&mdash;some
one, and they said that was quite a
business arrangement, and thought I was rather
clever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth removed his pipe and cleared his throat.
Rosebud had not dared to look at him while putting
forward her scheme. Her heart was beating so
loudly, that it seemed to her he must hear it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;it&#8217;s not a bad notion in
some ways, Rosie. Ther&#8217;s jest the matter o&#8217; myself
wrong. I &#8217;lows you&#8217;d make a han&#8217;some return to
Rube an&#8217; Ma. Guess you needn&#8217;t to figger on me
though. I&#8217;ll stand by this old farm. I ken work it
single-handed. An&#8217; I kind o&#8217; notion the Injuns
around here someways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we couldn&#8217;t do without you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth shook his head. As she beheld the movement,
Rosebud&#8217;s lips quivered, and a little impatient
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
frown drew her brows together. She felt like shaking
him for his stupidity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m just going to do it, Seth. And&mdash;and
I&#8217;m sorry I said anything to you about it. I shall
buy it for Rube without telling him. And you&#8217;ll
help me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; more certain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s impatience had passed. A demure
smile had replaced the frown, as she stared out at
the flaming western sky. Presently she went on
with a great assumption of calmness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in a bit of a difficulty, though. You see, I
want to do the thing at once, and I can&#8217;t because I
haven&#8217;t got the money yet. I want to know if there
isn&#8217;t some means of arranging it. You see I only
have a certain income at present. Later on, I shall
get the whole fortune. It&#8217;s that silly business about
getting it when I&#8217;m married. And, of course, I&#8217;m
not married yet, am I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosebud felt a desperate desire to run away. But
she had never realized how difficult Seth was before.
His uncompromising directness was enough to upset
any one, she told herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must raise the money now. You see,
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t be done. You see, the dollars ain&#8217;t yours
till you marry. Mebbe they&#8217;ll never be yours.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
Mebbe you won&#8217;t never marry. I guess every
female don&#8217;t allus marry. No, can&#8217;t be done, I
guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;o. I never looked at it like that before.
No. The money isn&#8217;t mine, is it? So, of course, I
can&#8217;t do it. Oh, Seth, I am disappointed!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s face had dropped, and there was something
almost tragic in her tone. Seth heard the tone
and it smote his heart, and made him long to take
her in his arms and comfort her. He hated himself
for what he had said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, little Rosie,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;I was only
jest lookin&#8217; straight at it. Guess them dollars is
yours. It&#8217;s jest a question o&#8217; gettin&#8217; married.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl had turned away again. The sky was
fast darkening, and a deep grayness was spreading
from the east. And now, without turning, she said
quietly&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I must get married. But there&#8217;s no one
wants to marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth drew a deep breath and stirred uneasily.</p>
<p>There was another long pause while Rosebud sat
silently and unconsciously listening to the thumping
of her own heart, and Seth tried hopelessly to relight
a pipe in which all the tobacco had burnt out.</p>
<p>Suddenly Rosebud faced round. The growing
darkness concealed the deep flush which had now
taken possession of her cheeks, and spread even to
brow and throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do want that money, Seth,&#8221; she said in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
low tone. &#8220;And&mdash;and&mdash;you said&mdash;you promised
you would help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a sharp sound of an empty pipe falling
to the ground. Two strong rough hands were suddenly
thrust out and rested in a steady grasp upon
the girl&#8217;s rounded shoulders. They slid their way
upward until her soft cheeks were resting in their
palms.</p>
<p>Rosebud felt her face lifted until she found herself
gazing into the man&#8217;s dark eyes which, in the darkness,
were shining with a great love light. Her lids
drooped before such passionate intensity. And her
heart thrilled with rapture as she listened to his
rough, honest words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Rosie, gal, you don&#8217;t jest know what you&#8217;re
sayin&#8217;. I hadn&#8217;t meant to, sure, but now I can&#8217;t jest
help it. My wits seem somehow gone, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t
guess as you&#8217;ll ever forgive me. Ther&#8217;s only one
way I ken help you, little gal. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t right. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t
honest, I know, but I guess I&#8217;m weak-kneed &#8217;bout
things now. I love you that bad I jest want to
marry you. Guess I&#8217;ve loved you right along. I
loved you when I picked you up in these arms nigh
seven years ago. I loved you when I bandaged up
that golden head o&#8217; yours. An&#8217; I&#8217;ve loved you&mdash;ever
since. Rosie, gal, I jest don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m
sayin&#8217;. How ken I? I&#8217;m daft&mdash;jest daft wi&#8217; love of
you. I&#8217;ve tried to be honest by you. I&#8217;ve tried to
do my duty by you&mdash;but I jest can&#8217;t no longer, &#8217;cos
I love you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span></p>
<p>But he abruptly released her, and blindly groped
on the ground for his pipe. He had suddenly
realized that his actions, his words were past all
forgiveness.</p>
<p>He did not find his pipe. Rosebud was kneeling
now, and, as he stooped, his head came into contact
with hers. In an instant his arms were about her
slight figure, and he was crushing her to his breast
in a passionate embrace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, God! I love you, Rosie!&#8221; he cried, with
all the pent-up passion of years finding vent in the
exclamation.</p>
<p>Her face was raised to his; his lips sought hers,
soft and warm. He kissed her again and again.
He had no words. His whole soul was crying out
for her. She was his, and he was holding her in his
arms. Cost what it might afterward she was his
for this one delirious moment.</p>
<p>But the moment passed all too swiftly. Reason
returned to him, and his arms dropped from about
her as he realized the enormity of his offence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Child&mdash;little Rosie,&#8221; he cried brokenly, &#8220;I&#8217;m
crazy! What&mdash;what have I done?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Rosebud did not go from him as he had expected
she would. She did not stir. Her face was
hidden from him, and he could not see the anger he
expected to read there. She answered him. And
her answer was meek&mdash;very, very humble.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve let go of me,&#8221; she said in a low voice.
&#8220;And&mdash;and I was so comfortable&mdash;so&mdash;so&mdash;happy!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Happy?&#8221; reëchoed Seth.</p>
<p>She was in his arms again. Night had fallen and
all was still. No words were spoken between them
for many minutes. Those rapturous moments were
theirs alone, none could see, none could know. At
length it was Rosebud who looked up from the pillow
of his breast. Her lovely eyes were shining even in
the darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth&mdash;dear&mdash;you will help me? You will be my&mdash;partner
in the ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>And the man&#8217;s answer came with a ring of deep
happiness in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Rosie, gal&mdash;if you&#8217;ll make it partners for&mdash;life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Somehow when he came to look back on these
moments Seth never quite realized how it all came
about&mdash;this wondrous happiness that was his. But
then&mdash;yes, perhaps, he was &#8220;ter&#8217;ble slow,&#8221; as Ma
Sampson had said.</p>

<p>A series of romances containing several of the old favorites in the field
of historical fiction, replete with powerful romances of love and diplomacy
that excel in thrilling and absorbing interest.</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<p><b>DARNLEY.</b> A Romance of the times of Henry VIII. and Cardinal Wolsey.
By G. P. R. James. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis.
Price, $1.00.</p>
<p>In point of publication, &#8220;Darnley&#8221; is that work by Mr. James which
follows &#8220;Richelieu,&#8221; and, if rumor can be credited, it was owing to the advice
and insistence of our own Washington Irving that we are indebted
primarily for the story, the young author questioning whether he could
properly paint the difference in the characters of the two great cardinals.
And it is not surprising that James should have hesitated; he had been
eminently successful in giving to the world the portrait of Richelieu as a
man, and by attempting a similar task with Wolsey as the theme, was
much like tempting fortune. Irving insisted that &#8220;Darnley&#8221; came naturally
in sequence, and this opinion being supported by Sir Walter Scott,
the author set about the work.</p>
<p>As a historical romance &#8220;Darnley&#8221; is a book that can be taken up
pleasurably again and again, for there is about it that subtle charm which
those who are strangers to the works of G. P. R. James have claimed was
only to be imparted by Dumas.</p>
<p>If there was nothing more about the work to attract especial attention,
the account of the meeting of the kings on the historic &#8220;field of the cloth of
gold&#8221; would entitle the story to the most favorable consideration of every
reader.</p>
<p>There is really but little pure romance in this story, for the author has
taken care to imagine love passages only between those whom history has
credited with having entertained the tender passion one for another, and
he succeeds in making such lovers as all the world must love.</p>
<p><b>CAPTAIN BRAND, OF THE SCHOONER CENTIPEDE.</b> By Lieut.
Henry A. Wise, U.S.N. (Harry Gringo). Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations
by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>
<p>The re-publication of this story will please those lovers of sea yarns
who delight in so much of the salty flavor of the ocean as can come through
the medium of a printed page, for never has a story of the sea and those
&#8220;who go down in ships&#8221; been written by one more familiar with the scenes
depicted.</p>
<p>The one book of this gifted author which is best remembered, and which
will be read with pleasure for many years to come, is &#8220;Captain Brand,&#8221;
who, as the author states on his title page, was a &#8220;pirate of eminence in
the West Indies.&#8221; As a sea story pure and simple, &#8220;Captain Brand&#8221; has
never been excelled and as a story of piratical life, told without the usual
embellishments of blood and thunder, it has no equal.</p>
<p><b>NICK OF THE WOODS.</b> A story of the Early Settlers of Kentucky. By
Robert Montgomery Bird. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>
<p>This most popular novel and thrilling story of early frontier life in
Kentucky was originally published in the year 1837. The novel, long out of
print, had in its day a phenomenal sale, for its realistic presentation of
Indian and frontier life in the early days of settlement in the South, narrated
in the tale with all the art of a practiced writer. A very charming
love romance runs through the story. This new and tasteful edition of
&#8220;Nick of the Woods&#8221; will be certain to make many new admirers for
this enchanting story from Dr. Bird&#8217;s clever and versatile pen.</p>

<p><b>WINDSOR CASTLE.</b> A Historical Romance of the Reign of Henry VIII,
Catharine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. By Wm. Harrison Ainsworth. Cloth
12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank. Price, $1.00.</p>
<p>&#8220;Windsor Castle&#8221; is the story of Henry VIII., Catharine, and Anne
Boleyn. &#8220;Bluff King Hal,&#8221; although a well-loved monarch, was none too
good a one in many ways. Of all his selfishness and unwarrantable acts,
none was more discreditable than his divorce from Catharine, and his marriage
to the beautiful Anne Boleyn. The King&#8217;s love was as brief as it
was vehement. Jane Seymour, waiting maid on the Queen, attracted him,
and Anne Boleyn was forced to the block to make room for her successor.
This romance is one of extreme interest to all readers.</p>
<p><b>HORSESHOE ROBINSON.</b> A tale of the Tory Ascendency in South Carolina
in 1780. By John P. Kennedy. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J.
Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>
<p>Among the old favorites in the field of what is known as historical fiction,
there are none which appeal to a larger number of Americans than
Horseshoe Robinson, and this because it is the only story which depicts
with fidelity to the facts the heroic efforts of the colonists in South Carolina
to defend their homes against the brutal oppression of the British
under such leaders as Cornwallis and Tarleton.</p>
<p>The reader is charmed with the story of love which forms the thread
of the tale, and then impressed with the wealth of detail concerning those
times. The picture of the manifold sufferings of the people, is never overdrawn,
but painted faithfully and honestly by one who spared neither
time nor labor in his efforts to present in this charming love story all that
price in blood and tears which the Carolinians paid as their share in the
winning of the republic.</p>
<p>Take it all in all, &#8220;Horseshoe Robinson&#8221; is a work which should be
found on every book-shelf, not only because it is a most entertaining
story, but because of the wealth of valuable information concerning the
colonists which it contains. That it has been brought out once more, well
illustrated, is something which will give pleasure to thousands who have
long desired an opportunity to read the story again, and to the many who
have tried vainly in these latter days to procure a copy that they might
read it for the first time.</p>
<p><b>THE PEARL OF ORR&#8217;S ISLAND.</b> A story of the Coast of Maine. By
Harriet Beecher Stowe. Cloth, 12mo. Illustrated. Price, $1.00.</p>
<p>Written prior to 1862, the &#8220;Pearl of Orr&#8217;s Island&#8221; is ever new; a book
filled with delicate fancies, such as seemingly array themselves anew each
time one reads them. One sees the &#8220;sea like an unbroken mirror all
around the pine-girt, lonely shores of Orr&#8217;s Island,&#8221; and straightway
comes &#8220;the heavy, hollow moan of the surf on the beach, like the wild
angry howl of some savage animal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who can read of the beginning of that sweet life, named Mara, which
came into this world under the very shadow of the Death angel&#8217;s wings,
without having an intense desire to know how the premature bud blossomed?
Again and again one lingers over the descriptions of the character
of that baby boy Moses, who came through the tempest, amid the
angry billows, pillowed on his dead mother&#8217;s breast.</p>
<p>There is no more faithful portrayal of New England life than that
which Mrs. Stowe gives in &#8220;The Pearl of Orr&#8217;s Island.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>GUY FAWKES.</b> A Romance of the Gunpowder Treason. By Wm. Harrison
Ainsworth. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank.
Price, $1.00.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Gunpowder Plot&#8221; was a modest attempt to blow up Parliament,
the King and his Counsellors. James of Scotland, then King of England,
was weak-minded and extravagant. He hit upon the efficient scheme of
extorting money from the people by imposing taxes on the Catholics. In
their natural resentment to this extortion, a handful of bold spirits concluded
to overthrow the government. Finally the plotters were arrested,
and the King put to torture Guy Fawkes and the other prisoners with
royal vigor. A very intense love story runs through the entire romance.</p>
<p><b>THE SPIRIT OF THE BORDER.</b> A Romance of the Early Settlers in the
Ohio Valley. By Zane Grey. Cloth. 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>
<p>A book rather out of the ordinary is this &#8220;Spirit of the Border.&#8221; The
main thread of the story has to do with the work of the Moravian missionaries
in the Ohio Valley. Incidentally the reader is given details of the
frontier life of those hardy pioneers who broke the wilderness for the planting
of this great nation. Chief among these, as a matter of course, is
Lewis Wetzel, one of the most peculiar, and at the same time the most
admirable of all the brave men who spent their lives battling with the
savage foe, that others might dwell in comparative security.</p>
<p>Details of the establishment and destruction of the Moravian &#8220;Village
of Peace&#8221; are given at some length, and with minute description. The
efforts to Christianize the Indians are described as they never have been
before, and the author has depicted the characters of the leaders of the
several Indian tribes with great care, which of itself will be of interest to
the student.</p>
<p>By no means least among the charms of the story are the vivid word-pictures
of the thrilling adventures, and the intense paintings of the beauties
of nature, as seen in the almost unbroken forests.</p>
<p>It is the spirit of the frontier which is described, and one can by it,
perhaps, the better understand why men, and women, too, willingly braved
every privation and danger that the westward progress of the star of empire
might be the more certain and rapid. A love story, simple and tender,
runs through the book.</p>
<p><b>RICHELIEU.</b> A tale of France in the reign of King Louis XIII. By G. P.
R. James. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>
<p>In 1829 Mr. James published his first romance, &#8220;Richelieu,&#8221; and was
recognized at once as one of the masters of the craft.</p>
<p>In this book he laid the story during those later days of the great cardinal&#8217;s
life, when his power was beginning to wane, but while it was
yet sufficiently strong to permit now and then of volcanic outbursts which
overwhelmed foes and carried friends to the topmost wave of prosperity.
One of the most striking portions of the story is that of Cinq Mar&#8217;s conspiracy;
the method of conducting criminal cases, and the political trickery
resorted to by royal favorites, affording a better insight into the statecraft
of that day than can be had even by an exhaustive study of history.
It is a powerful romance of love and diplomacy, and in point of thrilling
and absorbing interest has never been excelled.</p>

<p><b>A COLONIAL FREE-LANCE.</b> A story of American Colonial Times. By
Chauncey C. Hotchkiss. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>
<p>A book that appeals to Americans as a vivid picture of Revolutionary
scenes. The story is a strong one, a thrilling one. It causes the true
American to flush with excitement, to devour chapter after chapter, until
the eyes smart, and it fairly smokes with patriotism. The love story is a
singularly charming idyl.</p>
<p><b>THE TOWER OF LONDON.</b> A Historical Romance of the Times of Lady
Jane Grey and Mary Tudor. By Wm. Harrison Ainsworth. Cloth, 12mo. with
four illustrations by George Cruikshank. Price, $1.00.</p>
<p>This romance of the &#8220;Tower of London&#8221; depicts the Tower as palace,
prison and fortress, with many historical associations. The era is the
middle of the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>The story is divided into two parts, one dealing with Lady Jane Grey,
and the other with Mary Tudor as Queen, introducing other notable characters
of the era. Throughout the story holds the interest of the reader
in the midst of intrigue and conspiracy, extending considerably over a
half a century.</p>
<p><b>IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING.</b> A Romance of the American Revolution.
By Chauncey C. Hotchkiss. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>
<p>Mr. Hotchkiss has etched in burning words a story of Yankee bravery,
and true love that thrills from beginning to end, with the spirit of the
Revolution. The heart beats quickly, and we feel ourselves taking a
part in the exciting scenes described. His whole story is so absorbing
that you will sit up far into the night to finish it. As a love romance
it is charming.</p>
<p><b>GARTHOWEN.</b> A story of a Welsh Homestead. By Allen Raine. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a little idyl of humble life and enduring love, laid bare before
us, very real and pure, which in its telling shows us some strong points of
Welsh character&mdash;the pride, the hasty temper, the quick dying out of wrath....
We call this a well-written story, interesting alike through its
romance and its glimpses into another life than ours. A delightful and
clever picture of Welsh village life. The result is excellent.&#8221;&mdash;Detroit Free
Press.</p>
<p><b>MIFANWY.</b> The story of a Welsh Singer. By Allan Raine. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a love story, simple, tender and pretty as one would care to
read. The action throughout is brisk and pleasing; the characters, it is apparent
at once, are as true to life as though the author had known them
all personally. Simple in all its situations, the story is worked up in that
touching and quaint strain which never grows wearisome, no matter how
often the lights and shadows of love are introduced. It rings true, and
does not tax the imagination.&#8221;&mdash;Boston Herald.</p>
